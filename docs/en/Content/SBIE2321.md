**Message:** SBIE2321 Cannot manage device map: _[[ntstatus](NtStatusCodes.md) / yy]_

**Logged To:** [Popup Message Log](PopupMessageLog.md).

**Explanation:**

The device map is the set of drive letters in the Windows sessions and their corresponding devices. Normally, a program (whether it is running sandboxed or not) automatically inherits the device map of the session in which it is running.

However, in some cases, Sandboxie starts programs in a way that disassociates them from the device map. In these cases, Sandboxie also makes an attempt to restore the correct device map. This message indicates that the device map could not be applied to the sandboxed program because some error has occurred.
