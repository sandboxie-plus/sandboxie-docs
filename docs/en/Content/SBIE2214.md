# SBIE2214

**Message:** SBIE2214 Request to start service _name_ was denied due to dropped rights

**Logged To:** [Popup Message Log](PopupMessageLog.md).

**Explanation:**

The [Drop Rights](RestrictionsSettings.md#drop-rights) setting is enabled in the sandbox, and this prevents the service program from starting with full (LocalSystem) privileges.

Note that the 64-bit edition of Sandboxie enables the [Drop Rights](RestrictionsSettings.md#drop-rights) setting by default.

This message is followed by message [SBIE2219](SBIE2219.md).

**Resolution:** Turn off the [Drop Rights](RestrictionsSettings.md#drop-rights) setting.
