# SBIE2103


**Message:** SBIE2103 Denied attempt to load system driver _driver_

**Logged To:** [Popup Message Log](PopupMessageLog.md).

**Explanation:**

This is an informational message.

Programs running under the supervision of Sandboxie are stripped of privileges required to start drivers. ~~(Unless this is explicitly allowed through the [Block Drivers](BlockDrivers.md) settings.)~~

This message indicates that a sandboxed program has requested to start a driver, and that the request was denied.

Note, depending on the circumstances, this message _may_ indicate that an attempt to install a malicious [rootkit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootkit) into the system, has been subverted by Sandboxie. On the other hand, if this message appears during the sandboxed installation of a program that is known to install and activate drivers, then the previous statement does not apply.
