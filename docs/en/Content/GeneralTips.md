*   Setting: Display a border around the window

This setting tells Sandboxie to draw a color border around windows that belong to programs running in this sandbox. The default color is yellow, but you can select a different color for every sandbox.

Alternatively, if you wish to blur the distinction between programs running under the supervision of Sandboxie and those that are not, select the setting "Don't show Sandboxie indicator in the window title."
