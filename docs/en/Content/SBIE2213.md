# SBIE2213

**Message:** SBIE2213 Windows Credentials cannot be stored in the sandbox

**Logged To:** [Popup Message Log](PopupMessageLog.md).

**Explanation:**

Windows Credentials are username and password information stored in Windows by some Microsoft applications. For example, Windows Messenger stores email addresses and passwords as Windows Credentials.

Sandboxie provides its own implementation of Windows Credentials which stores the information in the sandbox in order to keep them isolated from the rest of the system. To disable this implementation of isolated credentials, specify the [OpenCredentials](OpenCredentials.md)=y setting.

This message is an indication that the Sandboxie implementation of Windows Credentials was asked to store Windows Credentials but failed to do so. The credentials in question are discarded.
