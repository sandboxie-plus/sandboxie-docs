# SBIE1214

**OBSOLETE**

**Message:** SBIE1214 Cannot inject SbieDll _[xxxxxxxx]_

**Logged To:** [Popup Message Log](PopupMessageLog.md).

**Explanation:**

The Sandboxie driver component was not able to inject (load) the Sandboxie DLL component into a sandboxed program that was started in the sandbox.

This error rarely occurs, but when it does, it is typically for very small programs or for very large and complicated programs. In either case, it may be possible to work around this error by compressing the program executable file using [UPX](https://upx.github.io).
