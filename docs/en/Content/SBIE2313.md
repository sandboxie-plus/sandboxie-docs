**Message:** SBIE2313 Could not execute _program.exe_

**Logged To:** [Popup Message Log](PopupMessageLog.md).

**Explanation:**

Sandboxie was not able to execute one of its own programs. Check access permissions to the Sandboxie installation folder and/or reinstall Sandboxie.

**Possible Causes**

*   Sandboxie was configured to block access to the folder containing its program files. See [Sandbox Settings > Resource Access > File Access > Blocked Access](ResourceAccessSettings.md#file-access--blocked-access).

*   A third-party (HIPS) security software was configured to block the execution of the program mentioned in the message.

**Known Conflicts**

The message: SBIE2313 Could not execute SandboxieDcomLaunch.exe
