# SBIE9153


**Message:** SBIE9153 Cannot start driver (SbieDrv)

**Logged To:** [System Event Log](SystemEventLog.md)

**Explanation:**

The service component of Sandboxie (SbieSvc) was not able to start the driver component of Sandboxie (SbieDrv). The message does not specify the cause of the error, because that information is not known.

Some possible causes for the error:

*   The driver component SbieDrv is not installed correctly. Try to re-install Sandboxie over itself (an update/upgrade installation). If that does not resolve the problem, try to uninstall Sandboxie and re-install a fresh copy.

*   The driver is blocked by Windows. Examine the [System Event Log](SystemEventLog.md) for any related messages from Windows.

*   The driver is blocked by third-party security software. Consult the documentation for your third-party security software.
