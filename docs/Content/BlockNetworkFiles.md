# Block Network Files

BlockNetworkFiles is a sandbox setting in [Sandboxie Ini](SandboxieIni.md). It specifies whether Sandboxie will block sandboxed programs from accessing network files and folders without specifically opened.
```
   .
   .
   .
   [DefaultBox]
   BlockNetworkFiles=n
```

Specifying _n_ indicates that a sandboxed program may access network files without specifically opened, in this case "Net Share" will appear in sandbox status.
