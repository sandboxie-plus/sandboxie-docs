# SBIE2203


**Message:** SBIE2203 Failed to communicate with Sandboxie Service: _detail_

**Logged To:** [Popup Message Log](PopupMessageLog.md).

**Explanation:**

The Sandboxie DLL component executing within the sandboxed program needs to communicate with the Sandboxie service component (SbieSvc). This message indicates that some communication failure has occurred.

When _detail_ is _connect_, the likely reason is that the Sandboxie service is not running.

Any other value of _detail_ indicates that communication has been established, but could not be completed, due to some error.
