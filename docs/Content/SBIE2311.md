# SBIE2311

**Message:** SBIE2311 Could not disable recycle bin (BitBucket): _[yy / [ntstatus](NtStatusCodes.md)]_

**Logged To:** [Popup Message Log](PopupMessageLog.md).

**Explanation:**

Sandboxie attempted to customize the sandbox in such a way as to disable the Recycle Bin for sandboxed programs. Instead, sandboxed programs should delete files and folders directly, without using the Recycle Bin. This message indicates the customization has failed due to an error.
