# SBIE1105

**Message:** SBIE1105 Unknown operating system version: _x.yy_

**Logged To:** [System Event Log](SystemEventLog.md)

**Explanation:**

The driver component of Sandboxie could not complete initialization. The driver component integrates into the core of the operating system (also called the kernel). For this integration to work seamlessly, the driver must recognize the operating system. This message indicates the driver did not recognize the operating system.

This message is followed by message [SBIE1103](SBIE1103.md).
