# SBIE2315


**Message:** SBIE2315 Could not fix executable image

**Logged To:** [Popup Message Log](PopupMessageLog.md).

**Explanation:**

As explained in message [SBIE1214](SBIE1214.md), the Sandboxie driver injects the Sandboxie DLL component into a sandboxed program that was started in the sandbox.

When the DLL component starts executing within the sandboxed program, it first needs to "clean up" the side-effects of the injection. This message indicates an error has occurred and the clean-up is not possible.
