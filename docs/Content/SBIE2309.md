# SBIE2309


**Message:** SBIE2309 Could not disable COM+/DCOM: _[yy / [ntstatus](NtStatusCodes.md)]_

**Logged To:** [Popup Message Log](PopupMessageLog.md).

**Explanation:**

Sandboxie attempted to customize the sandbox in such a way as to disable cross-computer COM connectivity (DCOM) from within the sandbox. The customization prevents the COM framework in the sandbox (see [SandboxieRpcSs](ServicePrograms.md#remote-procedure-call-rpc) and [SandboxieDcomLaunch](ServicePrograms.md#dcom-server-process-launcher)) from providing this cross-computer connectivity. This message indicates the customization has failed due to an error.
