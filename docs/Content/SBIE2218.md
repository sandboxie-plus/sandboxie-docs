# SBIE2218

**Message:** SBIE2218 Failed to get elevated privileges: _[xx / yyyyyyyy]_

**Logged To:** [Popup Message Log](PopupMessageLog.md).

**Explanation:**

Some error has occurred which prevents Sandboxie from successfully completing a privilege elevation operation which was issued by a program running in the sandbox. A privilege elevation operation can be:

*   a request to start some service in the sandbox, or
*   on Windows Vista and later, a request to use User Account Control (UAC) to elevate to Administrator privileges.

This message is followed by message [SBIE2219](SBIE2219.md).

**Resolution:** This error might occur during program installation. A possible workaround is to run the installation with Administrator privileges: Use the right-click command Run Sandboxed to launch the installation setup program under Sandboxie, and make sure to select the Run as UAC Administrator option in the Run Sandboxed dialog box.
