This message indicated that the license had expired before Sandboxie became a free software in version 5.31.4.

The [FAQ Licensing](https://sandboxie-website-archive.github.io/www.sandboxie.com/FAQ_Licensing.html) page listed those extra features that were available only in the registered versions of Sandboxie.

~~To renew your license, invoke the Sandboxie License Manager: Open [Sandboxie Control](SandboxieControl.md). You can find it in your Windows Start menu, under the Sandboxie program group. Then, select the [Help Menu](HelpMenu.md) and invoke the **Register Sandboxie** command.~~
