# SBIE2331


**Message:** SBIE2331 Service start failed: _[yy / xxxx] text_

**Logged To:** [Popup Message Log](PopupMessageLog.md).

**Explanation:**

[Sandboxie Control](SandboxieControl.md) has detected that the Sandboxie service component (SbieSvc) is not running. Sandboxie Control then tried to start the service, but failed to do so. This message specifies the error code that prevents the service from starting.

For example, if the detail is _[22 / 5] Access is denied_, it indicates that the service SbieSvc is not running, and that [Sandboxie Control](SandboxieControl.md) is running in a user account which does not have the authority to start the service.
