# SBIE6008

**Message** SBIE6008 The configuration %3 of box %2 requires a supporter certificate and can not be used without it.

**Severity**: Error (popup)

## Description

This error is displayed when a box configuration uses features that require a supporter certificate, and the system does not have a valid certificate allowing use of that configuration. Unlike SBIE6004, which warns about certificate requirements and a grace period, SBIE6008 indicates the configuration cannot be used at all without the certificate.

## Typical Causes

- A box configuration enables one or more features gated behind a supporter certificate (for example, certain encryption or security mode settings).
- No supporter certificate is installed, or the installed certificate is not valid/active.
- The certificate is missing required option flags for the specific configuration.

## Suggested Actions

1. Inspect the configuration referenced by the message (`%3` is the configuration identifier) and disable features requiring a supporter certificate if you don't intend to supply one.
2. Install and activate a supporter certificate that includes the required option flags for the configuration.
3. Restart Sandboxie service and driver after installing the certificate so the new certificate is detected.
4. If the configuration should be usable without a certificate, review the feature flags and consult the driver/service logs to find why the certificate check failed.
