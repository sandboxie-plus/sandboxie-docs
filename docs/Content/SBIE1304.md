# SBIE1304

**OBSOLETE**

**Message:** SBIE1304 Blocked simulated keyboard or mouse input by process _program.exe_

**Logged To:** [Popup Message Log](PopupMessageLog.md).

**Explanation:**

This warning message appeared when a sandboxed program had simulated keyboard or mouse action which would have been received by a window running in another sandbox or outside any sandboxes. As a result, the keyboard or mouse action was discarded.

The point of this protection was to block a scenario where a malicious program running in a sandbox managed to circumvent Sandboxie by communicating with programs outside Sandboxie, such as the Windows Explorer. The malicious program could simulate keyboard actions that would instruct Windows Explorer to navigate into the sandbox and launch a malicious program.

**Games and Full Screen Applications:**

Sometimes this message was issued while launching a game or an application. In that case the message was not an indication of malicious activity, and it was safe to hide message SBIE1304, or to disable this protection.
