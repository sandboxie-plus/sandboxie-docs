# SBIE2211


**Message:** SBIE2211 Sandboxed service failed to start: _name_

**Logged To:** [Popup Message Log](PopupMessageLog.md).

**Explanation:**

Windows Services that are installed into the sandbox are managed by Sandboxie. This management includes starting and stopping the service. This message reports that the sandboxed service _name_ has failed to start.

**User Account Control**

In Windows Vista and later, software may not correctly install into the sandbox unless you enable the option [Run As UAC Administrator](FileMenu.md#run-as-uac-administrator) prior to running the installation.

Particularly, Windows Installer packages, which are installed through the Windows Installer service, require enabling this option. This is not a security issue: The "Run As UAC Administrator" option does not diminish the protection of Sandboxie in any way.
