# SBIE1241

**Message:** SBIE1241 Cannot mount registry hive: _[xxxxxxxx / yy]_

**Logged To:** [Popup Message Log](PopupMessageLog.md).

**Explanation:**

When a sandboxed program starts, Sandboxie may need to prepare the sandboxed registry for that sandbox. Sandboxie will load the [registry hive file](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry#Hives) into the system. This error message indicates a problem has occurred and the registry hive file was not loaded.

If yy is 11, the [KeyRootPath](KeyRootPath.md) setting may be improperly set, causing more than one sandbox to use the same registry location (or registry key).

If yy is 22, the registry hive file may be corrupt, or the drive containing the registry hive file (and its associated sandbox) may be full.

If yy is 33, the [FileRootPath](FileRootPath.md) setting may be improperly set, causing more than one sandbox to use the same registry hive file.
