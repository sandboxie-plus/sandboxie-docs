# SBIE6009

**Message**

SBIE6009 The configuration %3 of box %2 requires an advanced supporter certificate.

**Severity**: Error (popup)

## Description

This popup error is shown when a box configuration requires an advanced supporter certificate (a higher privilege set than a normal supporter certificate). The configuration cannot be used unless a valid advanced certificate is present and active.

Advanced certificates are used to gate features that further relax sandbox isolation or enable privileged proxy operations. Examples include advanced encryption handling, network proxying, or other sensitive capabilities that the project reserves for supporters.

## Typical Causes

- The box configuration enables a feature that requires an advanced supporter certificate.
- No advanced certificate is installed, or the installed certificate is not active or lacks the required advanced option flags.
- The driver/service failed to detect or validate the installed certificate.

## Suggested Actions

1. Review the configuration mentioned in the message (`%3` is the configuration identifier) and disable features requiring an advanced certificate if you do not intend to supply one.
2. If you need the advanced features, obtain and install an advanced supporter certificate and ensure it is active and contains the required option flags.
3. Restart Sandboxie components (service and driver) after installing a certificate so the driver can detect the change.
4. If you believe the certificate is installed correctly but the message persists, enable driver/service tracing and examine certificate query results via logs for troubleshooting.

- [SBIE6008](SBIE6008.md) - Configuration unusable without any supporter certificate; this is stricter and prevents use. Other certificate-related configuration errors (message codes reserved for certificate requirements).
