# Ransomware

Of all the classes of malware, ransomware may be the most destructive because often its not possible to recover from its negative effects.

While most malware is disruptive in nature (including banking Trojans that steal financial data and credentials, malware that targets information like intellectual property, and those that turn your machines into bots to send out spam campaigns), an organization can eventually recover from their damage after significant cost, effort, and time.

Not so with ransomware your important business data can be lost forever.

Did you know that ransomware can hold your data hostage, and can't be stopped with anti-virus software alone?

Sandboxie runs your programs in an isolated space which prevents malware - including ransomware - from making permanent changes to other programs and data in your computer.
