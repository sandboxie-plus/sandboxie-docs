# SBIE2308

**Message:** SBIE2308 Could not create object directory: _[yy / xxxx]_

**Logged To:** [Popup Message Log](PopupMessageLog.md).

**Explanation:**

Inter-process communication (IPC) objects are logical objects which are used for various forms of communication between programs. The IPC objects have identifying names and are organized into a hierarchial structure of directories.

Sandboxie redirects all IPC objects created by sandboxed programs to an isolated directory in the hierarchial structure, in order to guarantee separation of communications between programs inside and outside the sandbox.

This message indicates that Sandboxie failed to create the isolated directory.

**Guest or Limited Account**

If you are running Sandboxie under a guest or limited user account, make sure the user account is allowed to create IPC objects:

*   Open Control Panel > Administrative Tools > Local Security Policy
*   Expand Security Settings > Local Policies > User Rights Assignment
*   Find the entry named "Create global objects"
*   Make sure the guest or limited user account is listed for that entry
*   Find the entry named "Create permanent shared objects"
*   Make sure the guest or limited user account is listed for that entry
