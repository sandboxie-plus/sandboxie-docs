# SBIE1312

**Message:** SBIE1312 Blocked request to start a 16-bit DOS program in the sandbox

**Logged To:** [Popup Message Log](PopupMessageLog.md).

**Explanation:**

Sandboxie blocks the execution of 16-bit DOS programs in the sandbox, because Sandboxie cannot guarantee sandbox isolation for such programs.

Note that this message only appears in the 32-bit edition of Sandboxie on 32-bit Windows, as 64-bit Windows does not run 16-bit DOS programs.

One possible workaround is to install the DOS emulation software [DOSBox](https://www.dosbox.com) into a sandbox, and use that to run the 16-bit DOS program.
