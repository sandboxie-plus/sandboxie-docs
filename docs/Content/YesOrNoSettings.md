# Yes Or No Settings

Some settings [Sandboxie Ini](SandboxieIni.md) are boolean settings. That is, they indicate whether something is or isn't; they answer a Yes/No question.

To indicate the setting is enabled (or selected, or yes), specify Y.

To indicate the setting is disabled (or unselected, or no), specify N.

A boolean setting which not specified, or specifies some other value other than Y or N will silently revert to a default value which depends on the particular setting. For example, the default value for the [OpenProtectedStorage](OpenProtectedStorage.md) setting is N.
