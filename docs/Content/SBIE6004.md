# SBIE6004

**Message** SBIE6004 The configuration %3 of box %2 requires a supporter certificate. Processes in this box will be terminated after 5 minutes. For prolonged use, please consider supporting this project.

**Severity**: Error (popup)

## Description

This error is shown when Sandboxie detects that a box configuration requires a supporter certificate (or an advanced supporter certificate) which is not present or not active. The message is displayed as a popup and may cause processes in the affected box to be terminated after a short grace period.

Typical scenarios include features that weaken isolation or enable privileged proxy operations (for example, EFS proxying) that are gated behind supporter certificate options.

## Typical Causes

- A feature that requires a supporter certificate is enabled in the box configuration (for example, `EnableEFS`), but the system does not have a valid active supporter certificate.
- The installed certificate is present but not marked active or lacking the required option flags (for example, the encryption flag used for EFS proxying).
- The certificate verification failed when queried from the driver/service.

## Suggested Actions

1. Review the box configuration mentioned in the message (`%3` is the configuration name and `%2` is the box name). Disable features that require a certificate if you do not intend to supply one.
2. If you intend to use the feature, install and activate a supporter certificate that includes the required option flags.
3. Restart Sandboxie components (service/driver) after installing a certificate so the driver and service can detect the new certificate.
4. If you continue to see the message despite a valid certificate, collect logs (enable tracing) and check the service/driver certificate query path for errors.
