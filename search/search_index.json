Trigger The driver registers a PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine callback and when this is triggered inspects if the process should be sandboxed, when it decides so it blocks and requests the SbieSvc service to inject a loader into the process image. Alternatively a suspended process can be created and the driver triggered to put it into a sandbox by using API_START_PROCESS and resuming the process once the driver has finished. The injection mechanism itself can be adapted to be utilized without the driver. As of version 5.44 the loader code has been moved from the SbieSvc.exe to SbieDll.dll. Overview The Code Injection mechanism is made up of 3 components, the injector itself, a low-level shell code (LowLevel.dll), and the to be injected payload (SbieDll.dll). Note that the LowLevel.dll is embedded into the loader as a resource. Remote Injection The injection is done calling _FX ULONG SbieDll_InjectLow(HANDLE hProcess, BOOLEAN is_wow64, BOOLEAN bHostInject, BOOLEAN dup_drv_handle) and providing the required arguments, the function than: Starts with preparing a data block lowdata of type SBIELOW_DATA , and filling in various values like is_wow64, bHostInject and others... Than it uses SbieDll_InjectLow_CopyCode to allocate sizeof(shell_code) + sizeof(SBIELOW_J_TABLE) + 0x400 bytes of Memory in the target process and write the shell code to it. This function also, in an unrelated last step, copies 48 bytes from the begin of ntdll!LdrInitializeThunk into lowdata.LdrInitializeThunk_tramp . Than if dup_drv_handle was set SbieDll_InjectLow_SendHandle is used to open a handle to the driver and duplicate it into the process, saving its value to lowdata.api_device_handle . Than duplicates of a couple of required NTDLL functions are saved to the lowdata data block, and the address of the SBIELOW_J_TABLE section is stored to lowdata.Sbie64bitJumpTable . Than the actual trampoline is build by SbieDll_InjectLow_BuildTramp in lowdata.LdrInitializeThunk_tramp . Now the function uses SbieDll_InjectLow_CopySyscalls to allocate and fill in another memory segment syscall_data . This block is made up of 2 sections one containing information from the driver that are used to hook all system calls, this is optionally done by the shell code when bHostInject == 0 , that is followed by the SBIELOW_EXTRA_DATA that points to values stored behind it in the memory block. The data stored there a couple of offsets, as well as the full paths to the SbieDll.dll that is to be injected later on. The address of that auxiliary memory is saved to lowdata.syscall_data and the lowdata block is written with SbieDll_InjectLow_CopyData directly into the shell code memory. Finally the ntdll!LdrInitializeThunk in the target process gets overwritten using SbieDll_InjectLow_WriteJump with a jump instruction into the shell code's entry point. Now the process can be resumed and the injected code will do its thing. An important note to make here is that this function does the same for native 64 bit and wow64 emulated 32 bit processes, in fact, on a 64-bit system the injected shell code is always 64 bit. Only much later in the initialization of the process running under wow64 it switches to 32-bit. Shell Code (LowLevel.dll) operation The LowLevel.dll is written partially in assembler and partially in C, its base address is set to 0 to gain position independence. The initial entry point _Start retrieves the current address and calculates the addresses of the data block data of type SBIELOW_DATA and those of a couple of helper functions written in assembler, with those values as parameter it calls the EntrypointC function handing off the operation to the C portion. The EntrypointC function ensures that it will be executed only once, using a spinlock, and then checks if the data->bHostInject field is set to 0 it first hooks all the ntdll sys call functions using InitSyscalls than it prepares the later loading of the SbieDll.dll using InitInject and , on 64 bit systems only, it calls InitConsole to modify the ConsoleHandle. If bHostInject != 0 the function only calls InitInject . Last the trampoline to the original function data->LdrInitializeThunk_tramp is called. InitInject The InitInject function checks if the process is running natively (i.e. 32-bit on a x86 system or 64-bit in a x64 system), or if it's running under wow64 (that is a 32-bit process on a 64-bit system) and selects either the native ntdll base address or the one of the wow64 ntdll. On Windows versions prior to 8, that address was located in KUSER_SHARED_DATA::Wow64SharedInformation structure, but not on later versions. Sandboxie used the driver to record the address of the wow64 ntdll during image loading and InitInject queried the driver for it. Since version 5.44, however, it's driver independent, the loader code uses NtQueryVirtualMemory to find the image base address and saves it into the ntdll_wow64_base field of the data block. At this point the top portion of the data->syscall_data before the SBIELOW_EXTRA_DATA region is no longer required and is repurposed to store temporary data of the type INJECT_DATA . The function than finds the addresses of LdrLoadDll , LdrGetProcedureAddress , NtRaiseHardError and RtlFindActivationContextSectionString using a custom FindDllExport lookup function by parsing through the previously selected ntdll image, these addresses are stored into the INJECT_DATA region, then a couple values from the SBIELOW_EXTRA_DATA are also copied into that region, containing paths to the SbieDll.dll (both 32 and 64 bit paths), as well as the name of kernel32.dll. On 64-bit systems the function distinguishes between the native and the wow64 execution, in the latter case branching off to InitInjectWow64 . In the native case it continues with hooking the RtlFindActivationContextSectionString function in the ntdll.dll. * An original copy of the functions begin is first saved to the INJECT_DATA structure * The address of the structure is written into the detour function which is implemented in assembler. * Than the RtlFindActivationContextSectionString begin is overwritten with a jump instruction to the detour function. * Last a pointer to the SBIELOW_DATA region is saved into the very top of the INJECT_DATA region, and the function exits. In the wow64 case InitInjectWow64 sets up the RtlFindActivationContextSectionString hook on the 32-bit version of the function in the wow64 ntdll.dll in a similar way. RtlFindActivationContextSectionString Detour In contrary to the above operations which are always executed natively, the RtlFindActivationContextSectionString Detour function is executed in the mode matching the bit-ness of the started process. * The function first restores the original RtlFindActivationContextSectionString begin. * Than it loads the kernel32.dll followed by loading the SbieDll.dll and retrieving the address of Ordinal 1. * Than it saves value of the first argument to the INJECT_DATA structure and replaces it with a pointer to said structure * Finally, it jumps to address of Ordinal 1, it uses a jump rather than call to invoke it so that when it returns it will return directly to the current caller. Payload (SbieDll.dll) operation The SbieDll.dll hook entry point Dll_Ordinal1 function starts of by obtaining a few required values from the INJECT_DATA structure that was passed as first argument, like the address of SBIELOW_DATA data block, and the original value of the first argument. Having copied the required values, it can free the no longer needed INJECT_DATA , formally syscall_data region. The function now checks if bHostInject is set to 0 in which case it Calls SbieDll!Dll_InitInjected this function hooks pretty much everything, ?, last but not least it calls SbieDll!Ldr_Init which sets up callbacks for dll loading and calls SbieDll!Ldr_Inject_Init . If bHostInject != 0 however SbieDll!Ldr_Inject_Init is called directly from Dll_Ordinal1 . Once the initialization is completed Dll_Ordinal1 runs the real RtlFindActivationContextSectionString with its original arguments and returns. As if all this hooking wouldn?t be enough SbieDll!Ldr_Inject_Init sets up yet an other hook, this time targeting the actual entry point of the starting process. The function saves the initial bytes of the entry point, and overwrites it with a jump to SbieDll!Ldr_Inject_Entry64 or to SbieDll!Ldr_Inject_Entry32 respectively. Those are implemented in assembler, they pass a pointer to the return address location as argument to SbieDll!Ldr_Inject_Entry and clean up the stack, then they return to the begin of the entry point. Ldr_Inject_Entry This function first restores the original entry point function from SbieDll!Ldr_Inject_SaveBytes and changes its caller?s return address to point to the begin of the entry point. This way once the caller returns the real entry point will be invoked. Then the function checks if bHostInject is set to 0 in which case it first calls SbieDll!Ldr_LoadInjectDlls and then SbieDll!Dll_InitExeEntry which performs the last initialization steps. If bHostInject != 0 it calls only SbieDll!Ldr_LoadInjectDlls this function checks the Sandboxie.ini for the InjectDll or the InjectDll64 respectively, and loads the additional dll?s if any are configured.","title":"Code Injection"},{"location":"Content/CodeInjection/#code-injection","text":"Sandboxie employs a particularly low level approach of injecting its code into processes during creation.","title":"Code Injection"},{"location":"Content/CodeInjection/#trigger","text":"The driver registers a PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine callback and when this is triggered inspects if the process should be sandboxed, when it decides so it blocks and requests the SbieSvc service to inject a loader into the process image.

Overview It is very difficult to reliably detect all classes of key-loggers. This section first explains why this is so, and concludes by offering a possible defense against them. First, a distinction must be made between several classes of key-loggers: external key-loggers rootkit key-loggers windows hook key-loggers windows message key-loggers scripted key-loggers External Key-Loggers External (or hardware) key-loggers are devices that connect to your computer in some way. Two examples are a small device plugged between the keyboard and the computer, or a device that snoops on radio signals transmitted by a wireless keyboard. The common principle of key-loggers in this class is that they are external to the Windows system on which they are spying. Software running within Windows cannot detect, remove or protect against external key-loggers. The other classes of key-loggers described here are software key-loggers which do operate within Windows. Rootkit Key-Loggers Rootkit key-loggers record keystrokes at the lowest software level, typically by positioning themselves as a second keyboard hardware driver (a filter driver, in Windows terminology). Once installed, this class of key-loggers may provide the best logging facilities, and may be difficult to get rid of. But to be installed in the first place, this key-logger needs the explicit help of the operating system, and so is easily blocked by Sandboxie. If such a key-logger attempts to install, Sandboxie should report an informational message SBIE2103 , unless the BlockDrivers setting (see also Sandbox Settings > Restrictions > Low-Level Access ) was explicitly used to disable this protection. Windows Hook Key-Loggers These key-loggers don't masquerade as hardware drivers, but they still have to ask the operating system to load them (or hook them ) into every program executing on the desktop. It is not uncommon for applications to install such hooks as part of normal operation, and blocking all of them would prevent some programs from running successfully inside the sandbox. Removed From Sandboxie - Block Hooks Command The approach Sandboxie takes is to honor the hook request partially, by applying the hook only to applications in the same sandbox as the requesting application. The BlockWinHooks setting (see also Sandbox Settings > Restrictions > Low-Level Access ) may be used to explicitly disable this protection. Windows Message Key-Loggers This class of key-loggers doesn't need any assistance from the operating system, and can only reliably record activity within one program. However, from the point of view of a supervisory program like Sandboxie, they don't do anything suspicious, and so cannot be stopped. In order for a program running on the desktop to actually process the keyboard input, the operating system sends that program a message describing the input. The message key-logger, which is likely running in the same process space as the program being logged, can snoop on these messages in a variety of ways, which don't raise suspicion. Typically this key-logger will be a secret Web browser plugin (or a secret component of a plugin), so it can easily record keyboard activity related to the Web browser. Scripted Key-Loggers This class of key-loggers target and compromise the Web site you will be visiting. This is in contrast to the three other forms of key-loggers discussed here, which target and compromise your own computer. The JavaScript and VBScript languages offer facilities for a Web page to react to keystrokes. Legitimate uses of these facilities enable the creation of sophisticated Web pages. For example, consider how Google and Yahoo! searches react to the keys you type in order to suggest a possible search string. Exploiting security weaknesses in a Web site, a spy embeds a scripted key-logger into one of the pages in the site. These key-logger are practically indistinguishable from other scripts on the same site, and can use the same script facilities to react to your keystrokes, record them or transmit them to a third-party site. Defending Against Key-Logger Sandboxie is not designed to detect or disable key-loggers, but it is designed to make sure that sandboxed software stays in the sandbox, that such software can't integrate into Windows, and that it can be completely discarded when you delete the sandbox. This means that if you take care to carry out all untrusted activity in the sandbox, you can always delete the sandbox to undo the effects of that activity, and restore your computer to a trusted state. The first step is to make sure your system is not infected by malicious key-loggers, prior to using Sandboxie. A system scan by an anti-virus or anti-malware tool should help here. Then carry out all untrusted activity -- such as browsing the Web, reading email, and testing unknown programs -- only in the restricted area of the sandbox. This doesn't mean you won't be infected by key-loggers, but it does mean you can get rid of them: You can make sure you stop all of them, by telling Sandboxie to stop all activity in all sandboxes. See also the Terminate All Programs command in the File Menu and the Tray Icon Menu . Once stopped, you can discard the traces of their program code, by deleting the contents of the sandbox. See also Delete Sandbox . Once discarded, they can no longer record your keyboard activity, and you are safe to browse to trusted sites and enter your passwords. Note that if you don't like to regularly delete your sandbox, you can set aside one sandbox for trusted browsing, and delete just that sandbox before carrying out the trusted activity. But it is still important to first stop all sandboxed activity in all sandboxes, for maximum protection. Another protection measure against a key-logger is to configure Sandboxie to deny access to the Internet for anything other than your Web browser, in an attempt to prevent the key-logger from sending out the recorded information. See the setting for \"the only program that can access the Internet\" in Program Settings . Note two caveats: The Internet access feature is neither a replacement for a proper firewall, nor was it designed as a mechanism to counter or hinder key-loggers. Some key-loggers could possibly circumvent the Internet access restriction by hijacking the Web browser to be used as a vehicle through which to send out the recorded information.

It is not uncommon to receive virus in an email message. Traditionally, your anti-virus and anti-spyware software works with your email software to identify malicious software as soon as it is received, or at least, as soon as it begins to execute in your computer. That works well for well-known viruses and spyware, but leaves you vulnerable to zero-day exploits , that is, vulnerable to malicious software that is not yet properly identified by the security software. Sandboxie offers another approach. If you run your email reader program sandboxed under the control of Sandboxie, this protection will also extend to any software spawned by the email reader, such as viruses and spyware, thus severely limiting the effects of the malicious software on your computer. For example, suppose you get an email message with the a virus that presents itself as an attachment called Click_Me_For_Best_Joke_Ever.exe . Suppose you don't know this is a virus, and further suppose that your anti-virus has not yet been updated to identify this particular virus. You click the attachment, and it delivers the best joke ever, but it also secretly installs malicious software. This example may not specifically name any known virus, but it is not at all farfetched. Quoting Wikipedia on Malware : \"Since 2003, the majority of widespread viruses and worms have been designed to take control of users' computers for illicit purposes ...\" See also: Construction (from Wikipedia) . If you run your email program sandboxed, then Click_Me_For_Best_Joke_Ever.exe also runs sandboxed, and any changes it makes to the computer, or software it installs, will be confined to the sandbox. These changes will be discarded in their entirety as soon as you delete the sandbox. Sandboxie is not an anti-virus, and will neither identify or warn about viruses. However, Sandboxie treats all software it runs as potentially malicious software which cannot be trusted, and will not let any program -- malicious or legitimate -- to break out of the sandbox and make permanent changes to your computer. Note that the virus itself, in its original form as an email attachment, will remain in your mailbox even after you delete the sandbox. However, a computer virus is a piece of software, not a living creature: It cannot cause any harm your computer by merely being stored in your mailbox. It must be invoked before it can cause harm. Thus if you always run your email program sandboxed, the worst that can happen is that you will rerun the virus inside the sandbox, and then delete the sandbox again. Eventually, your anti-virus will be updated to identify this attachment as malicious software. The following section is concerned with configuring the use of email software with Sandboxie. You may access your email online via a Web browser running under Sandboxie, as is the case with Hotmail, Yahoo! or Gmail, to name three of the many Web mail services. In that case, no special configuration is necessary, and the following section is not relevant. The Sandboxie protection comes at a small cost: You should always keep in mind that Sandboxie considers all content created within the sandbox as discardable content. This means for example, that a malicious program installed by a virus is placed in the sandbox and considered discardable. But it also means that if you save an email message to a file, then that file is also put in the sandbox and will be discarded when the sandbox is deleted. And most importantly, this means that Sandboxie will treat incoming new mail as discardable content. For this reason, you must configure Sandboxie to treat your mailbox data files as trusted content, or you stand to lose important information. To protect against accidental loss of data, Sandboxie will issue message SBIE2212 if you run your email program without first properly configuring Sandboxie. Sandboxie offers easy configuration for most popular email reader programs. See Sandbox Settings > Applications > Email Reader . You may also need to tell Sandboxie where your mailbox data files reside, in the following cases: If your mailbox resides in a non-default or non-standard location. If you use the Eudora or The-Bat! email software. To do that, open Sandbox Settings > Applications > Folders , select your email software from the drop-down list, and then select a folder location to be associated with it.

For a longer discussion, see Email Protection . Q. Why should I use Sandboxie to run my email software? A. Email software, as any other Internet-facing application, processes data that cannot be completely trusted, as it was received from the Internet. That data -- which is your email -- might contain viruses, and small bits of software designed to exploit vulnerabilities in your email software. By launching your email software under the supervision of Sandboxie, you can confine it to its sandbox, along with any potential viruses and exploits. See Email Protection for more information. Q. Will Sandboxie identify and delete viruses in my email? A. No. Sandboxie leaves this task to your anti-virus and anti-malware software. The job of Sandboxie is to provide the first line of defense and prevent a virus from infecting your computer, and potentially even your anti-virus software. Q. Message SBIE2212 appears when I run my email software in Sandboxie, does this indicate an error? A. No. As a safety measure, Sandboxie refuses to launch your email software under its supervision, until it is properly configured. For more information, see the reference page for message SBIE2212 . To learn how to configure support for your email software, see the next question in this FAQ. Q. How do I configure Sandboxie for use with my email software? A. Open Sandbox Settings > Applications > Email Reader and select the email software that you use. If your mailbox data files are not in the default location, see Sandbox Settings > Applications > Folders . Then, you should also test the configuration; see Test Email Configuration . Q. How do I run my email software under Sandboxie? A. You can use the Run Email Reader command from the Sandbox Menu or Tray Icon Menu of Sandboxie Control . You can also right-click Run Sandboxed on the executable icon for your email software. Q. How can I force my email software to always run under Sandboxie? A. When the software is already running under Sandboxie, go to Program Settings , Page 1, and select the checkbox to Force program to run in this sandbox . You can also use Sandbox Settings > Program Start > Forced Programs to accomplish the same. Q. My email software is periodically updated (automatically or manually). Will the updates become permanent? A. No. The updates will be installed in the sandbox and will disappear when the sandbox is deleted . To properly update your software, launch it outside the supervision of Sandboxie, then initiate the update process. If it is already set as a forced program (see previous question), use the Disable Forced Programs command before starting your email software. Q. Should I create a separate, dedicated sandbox just for email, or can I use the same sandbox for email and web browsing? A. This depends primarily on your habits. If you want the convenience of opening your email software by clicking an email link ( mailto ) in your browser, then you have to use (and configure) the same sandbox for both web browsing and email reading. On the other hand, some people prefer to isolate the two unrelated activities into separate sandboxes. There is no strict answer, and both approaches work well. Q. I want to launch my web browser in a sandbox, but not my email software. When I click an email link ( mailto ), the web browser tries to launch my email software in the sandbox. What should I do? A. You can avoid this issue by right-clicking the email link instead of left (normal) clicking it. The right-click menu will let you copy the email address. Then switch to your email software and paste the email address. If the pasted email address begins with a mailto: prefix, then make sure to delete that prefix, including the colon (:). Q. I want to launch my email software in a different sandbox than my web browser. When I click an email link ( mailto ), the web browser tries to open my email software in the wrong sandbox. What should I do? A. See the answer to the previous question. Q. I have a web mail account and I read my email via my web browser, do I need to configure anything? A. No, because in this case, none of your emails are stored in your computer.","title":"FAQ Email"},{"location":"Content/FAQEmail/#faq-email","text":"Questions and answers regarding the use of Sandboxie with email software.

For brevity, the text below mentions only viruses, but it equally applies to malware. Sandboxie protects your from viruses, malware, ransom-ware, zero day threats, etc. Sandboxie does not need to rely on virus database signature updates, heuristics, etc. If you get a virus in your sandbox, you simply delete the contents of that sandbox and move along. Your host machine, software and browser is not touched. Nothing on your host machine is harmed. Q. What does malicious software do? A. Malicious software is typically designed to infect your computer. This infection is accomplished by the integration with, or the taking over of, various aspects of your Windows operating system. Following this infection, different types of malicious software have different goals. For example, a virus program might spread to more computers, and a spyware program might record your keyboard activity. Q. How does Sandboxie protect against computer viruses? A. Sandboxie considers the program it supervises as potentially harmful, and keeps the programs bound within a sandbox , which is a kind of protective bubble. The program cannot escape the sandbox, and therefore cannot change, harm or infect your computer in any way. When you're done with the program, you delete the sandbox. Q. Does Sandboxie remove viruses? A. Yes, but not in the sense that Sandboxie discards just the viruses, and leaves everything else intact. What Sandboxie does is delete the entire sandbox, which deletes any viruses trapped within the sandbox, as well as any other changes (good or bad) that were attempted by the program running under the supervision of Sandboxie. Q. Is Sandboxie an anti-virus? A. No. While Sandboxie is a countermeasure against malicious software, it works differently from traditional anti-virus software. Unlike an anti-virus, Sandboxie does not attempt to identify or differentiate between \"good\" and \"bad\" (or harmful) programs. An anti-virus might not identify a new virus, and might let it slip by and infect your computer. Sandboxie, on the other hand, considers all programs as potentially harmful, and does not let any program modify your computer in any way. Q. Should I use Sandboxie instead of anti-virus software? A. No. Sandboxie can prevent a virus in the sandbox from escaping into your real computer. However, common sense dictates that it is preferable to prevent the virus from running in the first place. Therefore it is a good idea to use anti-virus software to prevent known threats, while relying on Sandboxie to be your first line of defense against threats that are not yet known to the anti-virus. Q. Is Sandboxie 100% fool-proof? A. No, but it tries to be as close as possible to 100%. At the same time, it is important to remember that Sandboxie is never the only software in your computer. Your other software, including your Windows operating system, might have security holes that could be abused by viruses in ways that no security software can prevent. Therefore it is always important to keep up with software updates. As the saying goes: \"The only truly secure computer is one buried in concrete, with the power turned off and the network cable cut.\" Q. Can the anti-virus detect a virus in the sandbox? A. Yes. Files contained in the sandbox are stored in the hard disk, typically in the folder SANDBOX in drive C. Programs under the supervision of Sandboxie can only operate within this folder, but there is nothing special about the folder itself. The anti-virus software may detect viruses as they arrive into this folder, or at any later time. Q. How should I respond to the anti-virus detecting a virus A. Your anti-virus should tell you where the virus was identified. If the virus was identified within the sandbox (typically, in the SANDBOX folder in drive C), there is little cause for alarm. You can immediately invoke the Delete Sandbox command, or you may direct the anti-virus to delete the virus file, or move it to quarantine. Q. When the anti-virus moves a virus file out of the sandbox and into quarantine, does it bypass Sandboxie? A. No. The anti-virus itself is not operating under the supervision of Sandboxie, even if the virus alert seems to indicate otherwise. Operating outside the sandbox, the anti-virus can reach into the sandbox folder, pull the virus file, and move it into quarantine. The process is similar to Sandboxie Quick Recovery , wherein Sandboxie Control reaches inside the sandbox to pull some file out of it. Q. Will viruses remain in the sandbox after I close all programs in the sandbox? A. Yes and no: 1. No, if your sandbox is set to automatically delete; 2. Yes, in the configuration, but only until you manually delete the contents of the sandbox. It is important to note that a virus file in the sandbox is just that -- a file , not much different from your average text file. Unless you move the file out of the sandbox and invoke it, there is little cause for alarm. Q. Do I have to securely wipe the contents of the sandbox to make sure the virus is gone? A. No. Although you can configure Sandboxie to use a third-party data wiping utility, the key point is to make the virus file itself inaccessible, and this is accomplished even with non-secure deletion. There is, however, an advantage to secure deletion, as discussed in the next answer. Q. Why does my anti-virus detect a virus in the System Volume Information folder? A. The System Restore component in Windows collects various files into the System Volume Information when they are deleted. While the intention is to protect your system, sometimes System Restore ends up making copies of virus files. These virus files are inactive, and even if restored, will be restored into the sandbox, so there is little cause for alarm. Nevertheless, it is a good idea to let your anti-virus get rid of any such virus files. Note that this will not occur if you securely wipe the contents of the sandbox (see previous question). Q. My computer is already infected with a virus, will Sandboxie protect against that virus? A. No. Sandboxie can only protect your computer from the programs that run under the supervision of Sandboxie. The virus which has already infected your computer is running unencumbered outside the supervision of Sandboxie. It might also serve as an infection channel and assist other viruses in the sandbox to break out of the sandbox and infect your computer. It is strongly recommended that you dis-infect your computer as soon as possible, then install Sandboxie to protect against future threats. Q. Does Sandboxie protect against the KillDisk virus? A. Yes. The KillDisk virus works by modifying the hard disk partition directly, bypassing any file systems. This kind of access has been blocked since Sandboxie version 2.33 (early 2006). Q. Can I install an anti-virus (or firewalls or other security software) into the sandbox? A. For most security software, the answer is no. This type of software wants to integrate with Windows in order to monitor access to files and network connections. Sandboxie is designed to isolate programs in the sandbox from the rest of the system, which means the security software will be unable to monitor the system correctly. Note that virus scanner software which does not include active (\"real time\") monitoring should be able to function correctly under Sandboxie. Please note: Not all Anti-virus \"suites\" will work. Sandboxie may not function with certain suites (Kaspersky.)","title":"FAQ Virus"},{"location":"Content/FAQVirus/#faq-virus","text":"Questions and answers regarding Sandboxie and viruses and malware.

Updating Firefox and its Add-ons In the default configuration, any updates to Firefox or its add-ons will happen only within the sandbox. When the sandbox is deleted, all such updates will be deleted as well. To avoid this problem, you should run Firefox outside the sandbox when you recognize that any updates are available. Let the normal Firefox finish updating, including any necessary restarts of Firefox. Finally, exit Firefox and restart it under Sandboxie. If Firefox is forced to always run under Sandboxie (as discussed above), use the Disable Forced Programs command to disable forced sandboxing for a duration of several minutes. Then follow the procedure in the preceding paragraph. Finally, use the Disable Forced Programs command again to resume forced sandboxing. Bookmarks, History and Favorites Setting: Allow direct access to Firefox bookmarks and history database This setting allows Firefox running under Sandboxie to store bookmarks outside the sandbox, so they can persist even after the sandbox is deleted. When this option is not set, bookmarks are stored only in the sandbox, and will be deleted when the sandbox is deleted. Please note that, starting with Firefox 3, the same file (called places.sqlite ) stores both bookmarks and the history of visited sites. Therefore this setting will cause Firefox to also store the history of visited outside the sandbox. One approach to this is to install the PlainOldFavorites add-on, which lets Firefox create and manage Internet Explorer-style Favorites in addition to Mozilla-style bookmarks. Then consult the discussion on favorites in Internet Explorer Tips . Bottom line: * If you don't mind the extra add-on, install PlainOldFavorites to enhance Firefox with Internet Explorer-style favorites, then read the recommendations for handling favorites in Internet Explorer Tips . * If you are happy with Firefox bookmarks, then select this setting. Cookies Setting: Allow direct access to Firefox cookies This setting allows Firefox running under Sandboxie to store cookies outside the sandbox (in a file called cookies.sqlite ), so they can persist even after the sandbox is deleted. When this option is not set, cookies are stored only in the sandbox, and will be deleted when the sandbox is deleted. An alternative approach is to this setting is to visit your favorite sites once with a normal Firefox, to get these sites to remember you in their cookies. Then switch to a Firefox under Sandboxie, so any new cookies are kept the sandbox until you delete the sandbox. Bottom line: If you regularly delete cookies, and plan to start regularly using Sandboxie, then you can keep this setting unselected, and you will not have to keep regularly deleting cookies. If you need web sites that you visit in a sandboxed Firefox to remember you, then select this setting. Phishing Database Setting: Allow direct access to Firefox phishing database This setting allows Firefox running under Sandboxie to update and maintain the database of phishing web sites (a file called urlclassifier*.sqlite ). When this option is not set, then whenever the sandbox is deleted, Firefox might have to spend time to copy the phishing database (potentially a very large file) into the sandbox, and then download updates to the database. The setting is enabled by default. Bottom line: Keep the setting selected. Full Profile Access Setting: Allow direct access to entire Firefox profile folder This setting allows Firefox running under Sandboxie to have access to any data file within the entire Firefox profile. This setting includes any other Firefox data file mentioned above, and overrides all other \"direct access\" setting discussed earlier. Bottom line: Do not select this setting.

If you have a program that doesn't work properly sandboxed, please look it up on the Known Conflicts page before posting a problem report. Back to HelpTopics What is Sandboxie and how is it different than other solutions? Think of your PC as a piece of paper. Every program you run writes on the paper. When you run your browser, it writes on the paper about every site you visited. And any malware you come across will usually try to write itself into the paper. Traditional privacy and anti-malware software try to locate and erase any writings they think you wouldn't want on the paper. Most of the times they get it right. But first the makers of these solutions must teach the solution what to look for on the paper, and also how to erase it safely. On the other hand, the Sandboxie sandbox works like a transparency layer placed over the paper. Programs write on the transparency layer and to them it looks like the real paper. When you delete the sandbox, it's like removing the transparency layer, the unchanged, real paper is revealed. Thanks to esalkin for the paper metaphor. Thanks to warwagon for the graphics. Back to Table of Contents How safe would I be, by using Sandboxie? You would be quite safe using Sandboxie. It should be noted that, from time to time, people are able to find some vulnerability in Sandboxie, an open hole through which malicious software can still infiltrate the system. This is very rare and is quickly resolved by closing the hole that is the attack vector. Thus it's a good idea to have more traditional anti-malware software. This is is the subject of the following question. Back to Table of Contents Do I need other solutions if I use Sandboxie? Sandboxie may be your first line of defense, but it should certainly be complemented by the more traditional anti-virus and anti-malware solutions. These solutions can let you know if your system does become infected in any way. Typically, those other solutions employ various forms of pattern matching to discover malicious software and other threats. Sandboxie, on the other hand, quite simply does not trust any software code enough to let it out of the sandbox. The combination of the two approaches should keep malicious software -- which is serving the interest of other unknown parties -- out of your computer. Back to Table of Contents What kinds of programs can I run using Sandboxie? You should be able to run most applications sandboxed. Major Web browsers Mail and news readers instant messengers and chat clients peer-to-peer networking Office Suites (MS Office, LibreOffice, OpenOffice) Most games in particular, online games which download extension software code In all cases on this list, your client-side program is exposed to remote software code, which could use the program as a channel to infiltrate your system. By running the program sandboxed, you greatly increase the control you have over that channel. And in addition, you can even install some applications into the sandbox. Back to Table of Contents What are the requirements to run Sandboxie? Sandboxie works on Windows XP SP3 (Up until Sandboxie 5.22 and solely in v5.40 ) Windows Vista SP2 (Up until Sandboxie 5.22) Windows 7 32/64 Windows 8.1 32/64 Windows 10 32/64 ( Modern Apps not supported ) Windows 11 64 ( Modern Apps not supported ) See the download page . Supported Web Browsers (32 & 64 bit supported) Internet Explorer 8, 9, 10 & 11 Microsoft Edge (Chromium) Google Chrome Firefox Opera PaleMoon SeaMonkey Vivaldi Waterfox Brave Browser And many others! Sandboxie does not work on... Windows XP x64 bit Windows 95, 98 or ME Mac or Linux operating systems. Sandboxie should not be installed on Microsoft Server Operating Systems as it's not directly supported. However, we have many users that have deployed it successfully. You can run Sandboxie in a VM Environment (VMWare, VirtualBox, Apple BootCamp, etc.) There are no particular hardware requirements to run Sandboxie. However, we do no test on touchscreen devices (many users have successfully installed Sandboxie on Surface pro and similar devices). Sandboxie needs only a small amount of memory and should have a very small impact on performance. Back to Table of Contents How does Sandboxie protect me, technically? Sandboxie extends the operating system (OS) with sandboxing capabilities by blending into it. Applications can never access hardware such as disk storage directly, they have to ask the OS to do it for them. Since Sandboxie integrates into the OS, it can do what it does without risk of being circumvented. The following classes of system objects are supervised by Sandboxie: Files, Disk Devices, Registry Keys, Process and Thread objects, Driver objects, and objects used for Inter-process communication: Named Pipes and Mailbox Objects, Events, Mutexes (Mutants in NT speak), Semaphores, Sections and LPC Ports. For some more information on this, see Sandbox Hierarchy . Sandboxie also takes measures to prevent programs executing inside the sandbox from hijacking non-sandboxed programs and using them as a vehicle to operate outside the sandbox. For the same reason, Sandboxie doesn't allow a sandboxed process from reading the memory of unsandboxed processes and it provides a feature to hide selected host processes from sandboxed processes. For more information about this, see #59 and 0.3 / 5.42 notes . Sandboxie also prevents programs executing inside the sandbox from loading drivers directly. It also prevents programs from asking a central system component, known as the Service Control Manager, to load drivers on their behalf. In this way, drivers, and more importantly, rootkits, cannot be installed by a sandboxed program. It should be noted, however, that Sandboxie does not typically prevent the exfiltration of user data by processes running under its supervision without advanced configuration, as the default file and registry access scheme is Allow Read to anything except when the user specified a particular path to be closed. However, by careful configuration of the ClosedFilePath and ClosedKeyPath settings, you can achieve this goal as well. If you want to follow the future development on this, see New privacy enhanced File/Registry access scheme, White list/Template Mode, plans and discussion . Back to Table of Contents Will Sandboxie protect me from malicious key-loggers? Yes, to some extent. First of all, your system (outside the sandbox) must not have been already compromised by an installed key-logger. Sandboxie can not protect against key-loggers that are already running outside the sandbox. You may want to consider always browsing sandboxed, so you don't accidentally get any key-loggers into your system. It is very difficult to reliably detect a key-logger. For a lengthy explanation, see Detecting Key Loggers . So the most important tool Sandboxie offers you for protection against key-loggers, is to delete the sandbox. When you stop all sandboxed activity (in all sandboxes), then proceed to delete the sandbox you're about to use, you can be fairly certain that all key-loggers are dead. Back to Table of Contents Some competing products require a reboot to initiate sandboxing, why? Changes to the computing environment must eventually make their way to disk storage, if they are to be permanent. This obviously applies to files. But it also applies to things like settings and preferences saved in the system registry. Some competing products require a reboot before each use, because they sandbox disk storage as a whole. They provide the operating system and everything in it with a single virtual disk, which is used to trap those permanent changes. The operating system is not designed to use one disk for some tasks, and another disk for other tasks. Therefore a reboot is required to switch to and from the virtual disk. Sandboxie does not require a reboot because it sandboxes access to files, rather than to the disk as a whole. It also sandboxes access to registry keys. It also sandboxes access to many other classes of system components, in order to trick the sandboxed program into believing that it isn't being tricked. This low-level sandboxing in some competing products makes it possible to install a wider range of applications and system tools -- including system drivers -- into the sandbox. Sandboxie can install most applications into the sandbox, but not system software nor drivers. It becomes apparent that, like most other things, each tool has its advantages and disadvantages, and one must choose the best tool for the task at hand. Back to Table of Contents Why am I getting some Messages from Sandbox Driver? Not all messages are errors, some simply inform you of an event that has occurred. For more information, see SBIE Messages and Log Messages To A File . Back to Table of Contents Why are so many files copied into the sandbox? When a program accesses a file, it declares what operations it plans to do on the file: if it plans to read from the file, to write the file, to change its attributes, and so on. Whenever a program declares any kind of write access to a file, Sandboxie copies it into the sandbox. In some cases, programs declare they intend to write to the file when in fact they do not, but nevertheless Sandboxie must copy the file into the sandbox. Back to Table of Contents What are SandboxieRpcSs and SandboxieDcomLaunch? See Service Programs . Back to Table of Contents How can I use Sandboxie to protect myself from viruses in email? See full article: Email Protection . Back to Table of Contents How to configure Sandboxie for only an occasional use? By default Sandboxie is configured to load and start automatically. To have Sandboxie load only when you need it, make the following changes. In Sandboxie Control , open the Configure -> Shell Integration window, and clear the checkbox When Windows starts to stop Sandboxie Control from starting. Open the Windows Services configuration window: Start menu -> Control Panel -> Administrative Tools -> Services . Then locate the Sandboxie Service. Double click to bring up its properties window. Set its Startup type to Manual rather than automatic. The driver component of Sandboxie is started by the Sandboxie Service. Therefore, setting the service to start manually, indirectly also sets the driver to start manually. Starting Sandboxie Control will also start the service. (But note that Administrative rights are required to start a service.) Back to Table of Contents How do I make Quick Recovery show my saved favorites and downloads? You may not see all your folders in Quick Recovery, as only a few are configured by default in the initial installation. See also Quick Recovery . Back to Table of Contents I saved a downloaded file, a document or an email inside the sandbox, how do I get it out? If you read What is Sandboxie then you know Sandboxie is like a transparency layer placed over the paper. (The paper is your computer.) When you save files (downloads, documents, emails, or anything else) through a sandboxed program, these files go into the transparency layer that is the sandbox. You can use Quick Recovery to get these files out. Unless configured otherwise, Quick Recovery looks in your Documents , Favorites , Desktop and Downloads folders. If you save the files to either of these folders, then you can use Quick Recovery to easily get them out. Another approach is configuring one or more folders as an OpenFilePath . Saving files into such folders bypasses the sandbox mechanism, and goes directly to the real folders. Setting this is more complicated, but may also prove useful, in some cases. Back to Table of Contents Why does the wrong program start when I run my default Web browser sandboxed? This happens for some people. In Windows 7, open Control Panel in Icon view and select Default Programs > Set your default programs. You can then select the browser you want as default. In Windows 8/8.1, point to (but do not click) the lower-right or top-right corner of the screen, and then click the Settings icon. In the lower-right corner, click Change PC Settings > Search and apps > Defaults. You can then select the browser you want as default.

An important point to keep in mind when using Sandboxie is that it is designed to isolate programs from each other. Therefore you should expect to lose a small measure of interoperability between programs. For example: Email: Clicking email ( mailto ) links typically causes your web browser to start your email software. This will not work correctly unless Sandboxie is configured to run your email software in that sandbox. See FAQ Email . You can avoid this problem by right-clicking the email link instead of left (normal) clicking it. The right-click menu will let you copy the email address. Then switch to your email software and paste the email address. If the pasted email address begins with a mailto: prefix, then make sure to delete that prefix, including the colon (:). Download manager: Clicking download links is intercepted and handled by software which is operating outside your web browser. When the web browser is running in a sandbox, this might cause it to start the download manager in the sandbox as well, which would probably not be the desired result. You can avoid this problem by right-clicking the download link instead of left (normal) clicking it. The right-click menu will let you copy the link. Then switch to your download manager program, and paste the link to start the download process. On the other hand, you should not expect to lose every measure of interoperability between programs. For example, you may use a dictionary software which should react to keystrokes or mouse-clicks to display information in a pop-up window. Sandboxie may or may not interfere with this, depending on how the dictionary software is designed. When things do not work as expected, please report it on the Sandboxie support and ask for a solution. Please also take some time now to review the many settings in the Sandbox Settings window. The settings are explained clearly, and you will find many settings that allow you to find the best balance between security and convenience. For example, one person may prefer greater security and control over web bookmarks and favorites, by letting them first save into the sandbox, and then recovering selected items through Quick Recovery or Immediate Recovery . (This is the default configuration in Sandboxie.) But another person may prefer to configure Sandboxie such that a sandboxed web browser can directly access the bookmarks or favorites, without an intermediate recovery step, thus sacrificing some security for greater convenience.

In these cases, Microsoft's free Debugging Tools for Windows can help to shed more light on the problem or even to identify the cause of the problem. Download and install the latest release of Windows SDK (both 32-bit and 64-bit). If you just need the Debugging Tools for Windows , you can install the debugging tools as a standalone component. The package installs into C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\10\\Debuggers by default. The package creates an application group called Windows Kits in the Windows Start menu. The application group contains the program WinDbg . You probably should use the 32-bit debugger, even on 64-bit Windows. You only need to use the 64-bit debugger to debug 64-bit programs. For more information, see Choosing the 32-Bit or 64-Bit Debugging Tools . Scenario 1: Start a program from the debugger Start the debugger under Sandboxie by using the Sandboxie Start menu. Sandboxie Control > Sandbox Menu > Run From Start Menu Sandboxie Plus window > right click on your sandbox > Run > Run From Start Menu Then navigate the Sandboxie Start menu to locate and invoke the WinDbg program within the Windows Kits group. The WinDbg debugger should start and open its main window. In the debugger, invoke the File menu > Open Executable command. Then navigate to and select the EXE file for the program that you want to run in the debugger. For example, navigate to and select C:\\Windows\\System32\\notepad.exe The debugger will open a command window, to control (or to debug) the new program. Use the Debug menu > Go command to begin the execution of the program. (You can also press F5.) At this time the debugger status line will change to say BUSY . Proceed to read the section below titled Final Step . Scenario 2: Attach the debugger to a running program In this scenario, you already used Sandboxie to start the program, and the program is already running. Start the debugger normally from the Windows Start menu: Locate and invoke the WinDbg program within the Windows Kits group. The WinDbg debugger should start and open its main window. In the debugger, invoke the File menu > Attach to a Process command. (You can also press F6.) Then identify the EXE file for the program to which you want to attach the debugger. The debugger will open a command window, to control (or to debug) the attached program. If you attached to the a program after it was already exhibiting the problem, then proceed to read the section below titled Final Step . Otherwise use the Debug menu > Go command to continue the execution of the program. (You can also press F5.) At this time the debugger status line will change to say BUSY . Proceed to read the section below titled Final Step . Final Step This section assumes the program in question has already exhibited the problem: If the program gets stuck in a loop, then it should already be stuck.

In these cases, Microsoft's free Debugging Tools for Windows can help to shed more light on the problem or even to identify the cause of the problem. Download and install the latest release of Windows SDK (both 32-bit and 64-bit). If you just need the Debugging Tools for Windows , you can install the debugging tools as a standalone component. The package installs into C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\10\\Debuggers by default. The package creates an application group called Windows Kits in the Windows Start menu. The application group contains the program WinDbg . You probably should use the 32-bit debugger, even on 64-bit Windows. You only need to use the 64-bit debugger to debug 64-bit programs. For more information, see Choosing the 32-Bit or 64-Bit Debugging Tools . Scenario 1: Start a program from the debugger Start the debugger under Sandboxie by using the Sandboxie Start menu. Sandboxie Control > Sandbox Menu > Run From Start Menu Sandboxie Plus window > right click on your sandbox > Run > Run From Start Menu Then navigate the Sandboxie Start menu to locate and invoke the WinDbg program within the Windows Kits group. The WinDbg debugger should start and open its main window. In the debugger, invoke the File menu > Open Executable command. Then navigate to and select the EXE file for the program that you want to run in the debugger. For example, navigate to and select C:\\Windows\\System32\\notepad.exe The debugger will open a command window, to control (or to debug) the new program. Use the Debug menu > Go command to begin the execution of the program. (You can also press F5.) At this time the debugger status line will change to say BUSY . Proceed to read the section below titled Final Step . Scenario 2: Attach the debugger to a running program In this scenario, you already used Sandboxie to start the program, and the program is already running. Start the debugger normally from the Windows Start menu: Locate and invoke the WinDbg program within the Windows Kits group. The WinDbg debugger should start and open its main window. In the debugger, invoke the File menu > Attach to a Process command. (You can also press F6.) Then identify the EXE file for the program to which you want to attach the debugger. The debugger will open a command window, to control (or to debug) the attached program. If you attached to the a program after it was already exhibiting the problem, then proceed to read the section below titled Final Step . Otherwise use the Debug menu > Go command to continue the execution of the program. (You can also press F5.) At this time the debugger status line will change to say BUSY . Proceed to read the section below titled Final Step . Final Step This section assumes the program in question has already exhibited the problem: If the program gets stuck in a loop, then it should already be stuck. If the program crashes, then it should already have crashed. If the problem condition has not yet occurred, you should now cause the program to malfunction. Once the program exhibits the problem, switch back to the WinDbg debugger command window. If the debugger status line still says BUSY , use the Debug menu > Break command to stop the program. (You can also press Ctrl+Break.) When the debugger status line no longer says BUSY , enter the following commands.

Internet Explorer with UAC Enabled In Windows Vista/7/8/8.1 with UAC enabled, Internet Explorer maintains two sets of configurations: Normal configuration and administrator configuration. Each set contains its own cookies, home pages and some other settings. When you normally launch Internet Explorer, you get the normal configuration. When you right-click Internet Explorer and select the Run as administrator action, you get the administrator configuration. Under Sandboxie, Internet Explorer selects the Administrator configuration. (But Internet Explorer does not necessarily run as Administrator under Sandboxie.) To fine-tune the administrator configuration, use the Run as administrator right-click action when you run Internet Explorer outside the sandbox. Windows Update on Windows XP When you wish to visit the Windows Update web site, you should run Internet Explorer outside the sandbox. If Internet Explorer is forced to always run under Sandboxie (as discussed above), then use the Disable Forced Programs command to disable forced sandboxing before and after visiting the Windows Update web site. Note the Automatic Updates facility in Windows does not rely on Internet Explorer and should not be affected by any Sandboxie settings related to Internet Explorer. Similarly, the Windows Updates window in Windows Vista also does not rely on Internet Explorer and is also not affected by Sandboxie. Favorites Setting: Allow direct access to Internet Explorer favorites Setting: Add Internet Explorer favorites to Quick Recovery folders These settings allows Internet Explorer running under Sandboxie to store favorites outside the sandbox, so they can persist even after the sandbox is deleted. When this option is not set, favorites are stored only in the sandbox, and will be deleted when the sandbox is deleted. The first setting (direct access) stores favorites directly outside the sandbox. The second setting ( Quick Recovery ) initially keeps the favorites in the sandbox but offers to recover (move out of the sandbox) any new favorites as they are added. The first setting is more flexible in that you can add, edit and delete favorites freely. The second setting is more secure, but at the cost of some measure of convenience. Bottom line: For greater convenience, select the setting \"Allow direct access to Internet Explorer favorites.\" Cookies Setting: Allow direct access to Internet Explorer cookies This setting allows Internet Explorer running under Sandboxie to store cookies outside the sandbox, so they can persist even after the sandbox is deleted. When this option is not set, cookies are stored only in the sandbox, and will be deleted when the sandbox is deleted. An alternative approach is to this setting is to visit your favorite sites once with a normal Internet Explorer, to get these sites to remember you in their cookies. Then switch to an Internet Explorer under Sandboxie, so any new cookies are kept the sandbox until you delete the sandbox. Bottom line: If you regularly delete cookies, and plan to start regularly using Sandboxie, then you can keep this setting unselected, and you will not have to keep regularly deleting cookies. If you need web sites that you visit in a sandboxed Internet Explorer to remember you, then select this setting. Feeds Setting: Allow direct access to Internet Explorer feeds This setting allows Internet Explorer running under Sandboxie to store feed links outside the sandbox, so they can persist even after the sandbox is deleted. When this option is not set, feed links are stored only in the sandbox, and will be deleted when the sandbox is deleted. Internet Explorer perdiocally checks its feeds from a component which is running outside the web browser. That component will not see (and will not check or refresh) feeds that are created in the sandbox when this setting is not in effect. (Technically, the component is a scheduled task. The task is created and altered whenever you use the Feed Settings tab in the Internet Options dialog.) Bottom line: If you work with Internet Explorer feeds, it is recommended that you select this setting. Save Outside Sandbox Setting: Save outside sandbox: History of search strings and invoked commands. Setting: Save outside sandbox: Account information for Hotmail and Messenger. (replaced with OpenCredentials since Sandboxie v0.8.0 / 5.50.0) The first setting allows Internet Explorer running under Sandboxie to store \"AutoComplete\" information, which is typically used for keeping history: History of search strings, or history of commands typed into an input box. The second setting allows Internet Explorer running under Sandboxie to store \"Credentials\" information, which is typically used by Microsoft web sites, such as Hotmail, to remember your Windows Live ID. It is also used by Windows (Live) Messenger. Bottom line: These settings are concerned with privacy more than security. Information that you enter into web sites can be kept permanently (as with a normal browser) or only until you delete the sandbox. To keep it permanently, select these settings. Otherwise, leave the settings unselected.

Not all programs can be installed or run inside Sandboxie Problem: Some applications that invoke services or drivers may not install/run inside Sandboxie. Solution #1: You may have a conflict with a third-party security software installed on your system (see issue #647 , #619 , #293 ). If you want to know more about which security suite could be involved, take a look at the archived forums . Solution #2: If you have already tried to install your application in a new empty sandbox, then install it on your host and run it sandboxed. If problems persist, especially with applications working on previous Sandboxie versions, please let us know the details by posting on the official Github repository here . UWP / Modern / Microsoft Store Apps Problem: Microsoft store apps will not work in Sandboxie Classic and Sandboxie Plus. Solution: None at this time. See issue #19 to track any possible change about this. Office 2013 on up & Office 365 (C2R Versions only) Problem: Click to Run versions of Microsoft Office 2013, 2016 and Office 365 will crash when sandboxed. This includes Outlook 2013 and up. Solution: A fix was included on v0.9.7 / 5.52.1 . It can be applied manually with most recent Sandboxie versions, see #428 . Tor Browser Problem: Tor Browser is very slow in a sandbox, crashes or crashes after a certain time. Solution: A fix was included on v1.0.21 / 5.55.21 . HP Universal Print Driver Problem: The HP Universal Printer Status Monitor pop-up component is failing when printing from a sandboxed Web browser. Solution: Open Sandbox Settings > Resource Access > COM Access, click Add and enter this resource name: {D713F357-7920-4B91-9EB6-49054709EC7A} Autodelete feature on Microsoft Edge Problem: Autodelete feature no longer works on Microsoft Edge. Solution: Microsoft Edge was updated with a new setting (under System) called \"Startup boost\", which is enabled by default. It prevents Edge from fully shutting down, so we suggest to disable the option or install v1.1.2 / 5.56.2 or newer versions which include the fix. Steam games Problem: Not all Steam games will function while Sandboxed. Solution: Install the games on your computer, not in a sandbox. Most games can work. However, there are known reports that some simply may not. If you run into a problem with a Steam game, you should make sure Steam client is updated on your host machine. Run Steam not sandboxed, download and install the game on your host computer and then \"right click\" on the game shortcut and select \"Run Sandboxed\" as a workaround. If problems persist, please let us know the details by posting on the official Github repository here . GOG Games and Galaxy Beta Problem: Games from GOG Galaxy may not run while sandboxed. Solution: No fix yet, see #1246 . You can \"force\" GOG Program folder so that it works correctly within a sandbox. See also: ForceFolder . MS Edge is stuck when you clean Media Foundation data Problem: MS Edge doesn't clear \"Media Foundation data\" while sandboxed. Solution: You can uncheck the option for the time being, see #867 . Chromium browsers like Edge or Chrome can not access microphone in any sandbox Problem: Chromium-based browsers can not access microphone while sandboxed. Solution: No fix yet, see #1208 . Tabs sessions on Chromium browsers are sometimes not restored correctly in Sandboxie Problem: Tabs sessions are lost when a Chromium browser is running outside of the sandbox. Solution: No fix yet, see #558 .

Normally, Sandboxie will not permit a sandboxed program to access, communicate, close or destroy a window outside the sandbox. The OpenWinClass settings makes an exception to this rule, and allows specific unsandboxed windows to be accessible. Special Forms OpenWinClass=$:program.exe/IgnoreUIPI This permits a program running inside the sandbox to use the PostThreadMessage API to send a message directly to a thread in a target process running outside the sandbox. This form of the OpenWinClass setting does not support wildcards, so the process name of the target process must match the name specified in the setting. OpenWinClass=# This setting tells Sandboxie to not alter window class names created by sandboxed programs. Normally, Sandboxie translates class names such as IEFrame to Sandbox:DefaultBox::IEFrame in order to better separate windows that belong to sandboxed programs from the rest of the windows in the system. However, in some cases, a program outside the sandbox might expect window class names to have a specific name, and therefore might not recognize the windows created by a sandboxed program. Specifying OpenWinClass=# resolves this problem, at the cost of a lesser degree of separation. Note that OpenWinClass=# does not allow communication with any windows outside the sandbox, and may interfere with some drag-and-drop operations. OpenWinClass=* This setting tells Sandboxie to not translate window class names as described above, and also makes all windows in the system accessible to sandboxed programs, and goes a step further to disable a few other windowing-related Sandboxie functions. This may also cause the Sandboxie indicator [#] to not appear in window titles. Note that OpenWinClass=* allows full communication with all windows outside the sandbox, but may interfere with some drag-and-drop operations. Identifying Window Class Names The unsandboxed windows are identified by their window class name , which is an internal name given to the window by the application that created it. You can use a tool like WinSpy to identify window class names. The Resource Access Monitor tool in Sandboxie Classic and the Trace Logging tool in Sandboxie Plus also display window class names.

Main Window The overall layout of the main window of SandMan.exe is exactly the same as the old one in SbieCtrl.exe when the \"Simple View\" is chosen. If the \"Advanced View\" is chosen, there are three additional tabs on the bottom of the window (\"Sbie Messages\" etc.), so it corresponds with what can be seen in the right picture. File and Sandbox Menus All important menu commands can be found in similar locations, although some have been moved. Create New Box dialog The \"Create New Box\" command opens the new box dialog. Unlike in Classic, here a box type preset can be selected. The feature to copy an existing box can be found now on another place. (See the following unit.) Copying Sandbox Configuration To copy a existing box configuration, the \"Duplicate Sandbox\" menu command can be used. View Menu The \"View\" menu offers a few more functions, and the option to enable a simplified view mode. The recovery log is no longer a separate window but a tab at the bottom (visible when the \"Advanced View\" is chosen). View Menu - Files and Folders The modern Sandboxie UI has replaced the \"Files and Folders\" view with a separate window that can be opened from the box context menu. Files and Folders - view / window The window \"Files\" offers the same functionality as the old view, but enhances it by providing a full context menu. Global Settings The new Sandboxie Plus UI has a global settings window (Options --> Global Settings) where all options are located together on vertical tabs instead of having to open individual windows. File System Root In the modern UI, it is possible to change not only the file system root path, but also the registry root and the IPC root. Program Start monitoring Sandboxie Plus can not only warn when unboxed processes are started, but it can also prevent them from starting at all. Shell Integration On this tab, the shell integration can be configured. Most functions are available, although some deprecated features were dropped and other options were moved out. Create Sandbox shortcut To create a shortcut to a boxed program, now an option in the box context menu is to be used, which can be reached quicker. Software Compatibility Also the compatibility dialog is now integrated into the window with the global settings (tab \"Compatibility\"). Lock Configuration Starting with version 1.9.0 / 5.64.0, the Configuration Protection options are located in the sub tab \"Sandboxie.ini Presets\" of the tab \"Advanced Config\". Sandbox Context Menu The sandbox context menu is much more advanced, and contains all the options from the old menu. Double click on the sandbox name now opens the sandbox settings. Explore Contents In addition to being able to explore contents, the \"Box Content\" sub menu allows to mount and browse the sandboxed registry. Sandbox Settings All functionality from the old Sandbox Settings are now located in the Sandbox Options. Some areas are similar, but many have also been moved around. Quick and Immediate Recover The options for Quick Recovery and Immediate Recovery have been merged into one tab (\"File Recovery\"). Delete Options The Delete Options have been moved to the sub tab \"File Options\" of the tab \"General Options\". Delete Command The \"Delete Command\" option can now be found on the sub tab \"Triggers\" of the tab \"Advanced Options\". Program Groups The new UI supports groups just like the old one. Forced Programs and Folders Forced programs and folders are also merged into one tab (\"Program Control\", sub tab \"Force* Programs\"). Lingering Programs & Leader Programs Program stop behaviours are also merged into one tab. File Migration File Migration options have been integrated into the \"File Options\" sub tab of the \"General Options\" tab. Internet Access Sandboxie Plus can not only use the old method of blocking internet access but also the Windows Filtering Platform (WFP), which provides better compatibility. Network Access Additionally, using the WFP facility, a per sandbox firewall can be configured (tab \"Internet Restrictions\" --> sub tab \"Network Firewall Rules\"). Start/Run Access Start restriction options have been promoted to a top level tab. Drop Rights The \"Drop Admin Rights\" option is in the new UI located on the \"Security\" sub tab of the \"General Options\" tab, together with additional security enhancements. Network Files \"Block network files and folders access\" has been moved to the \"Access Restrictions\" sub tab of the \"General Options\" tab. Resource Access The \"Resource Access\" options have been integrated into a joined view which shows all presets in one list, the options can be edited as well as disabled without removing them. Application Compatibility Templates The compatibility Templates are now also presented as a joined view (tab \"App Templates\", sub tab \"Compatibility Templates\"). User Accounts Last but not least, the ability to restrict a box to selected users has been moved to the sub tab \"Users\" of the tab \"Advanced Options\". About Dialog And finally, we have the About dialog.

It is important to emphasize that this is not a security breach as it will never allow sandboxed programs to infect or otherwise abuse your computer. However, this may be interesting reading for those concerned with the privacy aspects of using Sandboxie. Overview The guiding principle of Sandboxie is to isolate and contain any actions taken by programs that Sandboxie supervises, for the purpose of keeping your computer and operating system in a clean and healthy state. Most of the side effects of running a program under Sandboxie are in fact caused by the very program that is running under Sandboxie, and are gone when the sandbox is deleted. For example, a Web browser running under Sandboxie will record your browsing history in the sandbox, and this history will be completely erased when you delete the sandbox. Thus it is easy to make a small leap of logic from the guiding principle above, and assume that a principle of Sandboxie is to protect your privacy and clean any all traces caused directly or indirectly by any program running under its supervision. However, this assumption would not be correct. Sandboxie puts a great deal of effort into containing the actions taken by the program it supervises, however Sandboxie makes no effect at all to prevent your own Windows operating system from keeping records of what you do in your computer. One who makes the incorrect assumption of extreme concern for privacy on the part of Sandboxie might be surprised to find several kinds of traces and logs in Windows that record which programs have been running, even inside the sandbox. This page will explain the various known mechanisms that record information about the programs you run, either inside or outside the supervision of Sandboxie. Prefetch and SuperFetch Prefetch, introduced in Windows XP, and SuperFetch, introduced in Windows Vista, make up the prefetcher component in Windows. This component is designed to improve application start up time by keeping copies of program files in a location that can be quickly accessed. The copies are kept in a folder called Prefetch that resides within the main Windows folder; typically that is C:\\Windows\\Prefetch . Windows may store copies of programs files in this Prefetch folder even when the programs were executed under Sandboxie. Prefetch behavior can be reduced to caching only programs using during the boot sequence, or to not cache anything at all. Follow these links for more information: https://www.ghacks.net/2008/01/13/enableprefetcher-in-prefetchparameters https://www.howtogeek.com/998/change-superfetch-to-only-cache-system-boot-files-in-vista https://www.howtogeek.com/989/how-to-disable-superfetch-on-windows-vista MUI Cache Windows Explorer records in the registry the names of programs that are launched directly through it. This includes launching programs through the Start menu, the desktop, the quick launch area, or any folder views. It is true even if the right-click \"Run Sandboxed\" action is used to launch the program under Sandboxie. The recorded information is kept in this registry key: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\ShellNoRoam\\MUICache If launch a program through a Sandboxie facility (such as the Sandboxie Start menu) or through a program which is already running under Sandboxie, then this information is kept in the registry inside the sandbox. There are various third-party registry cleaning tools that can erase this information. Windows Taskbar On Windows 7 and later, Windows Explorer stores information associated with icons on the taskbar. This information includes the icon for the program and the command used to launch it. The information is stored in files in the following folder, within the user profile folder: %Appdata%\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\Quick Launch\\User Pinned\\ImplicitAppShortcuts The Sandbox Settings > Applications > Miscellaneous settings page includes the setting \"Permit programs to update jump lists in the Windows 7 taskbar\". If this setting is enabled, additional files are created in the following folders, within the user profile folder: %Appdata%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Recent\\CustomDestinations %Appdata%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Recent\\AutomaticDestinations Windows Page File During its normal course of operation, Windows sometimes needs to put away the contents of memory used by one program in order to make room for another program. The memory contents are stored in the Windows page file . Programs that run under Sandboxie are still running in the same Windows operating system as any other program in the computer, so portions of sandboxed and normal programs may end up sitting side by side in the same page file. It is possible to configure Windows to clear the contents of the page file at shutdown. More information here and here . It is possible to configure Windows to encrypt the contents of the page file: Run secpol.msc to open the Local Security Policy editor Expand the group labeled Public Key Policies Right-click Properties on the item labeled Encrypting File System Select Allow to enable Encrypting File System (EFS) Click Apply and then OK Reboot to put the new setting into effect Windows Hibernate File Similar to the Windows Page File, the hibernate file stores a copy of the memory and state of the system before the computer is turned off as part of the hibernate process. Thus the hibernate file may contain bits of memory that were used by a sandboxed program. System Restore Restore points are snapshots of the state of the operating system at some points in time. The System Restore component in Windows XP and later versions records and restores these snapshots. Snapshots are recorded in the (typically inaccessible) folder called System Volume Information and may include many types of files found throughout the system, including within the folders of the sandbox. Thus it is possible that System Restore will create backup copies in its folders for files or programs that exist only in the sandbox. The System Restore component can be set to ignore files and folders in temporary folders, so moving the sandbox to %TEMP%\\SANDBOX (instead of the default C:\\SANDBOX ) and adding the path within the registry key FilesNotToSnapshot , System Restore should ignore the sandbox when creating a Shadow Copy snapshot. More information here . System, Audit and Other Event Logs Windows sometimes records bits of information about running programs in its various event logs . Typically, very little if any information is logged about a program. However, if security auditing has been enabled for some aspects of the system, Windows will have no trouble logging the details of any actions taken by a program running under Sandboxie. Windows has an Event Viewer program which can be used to view and delete the event logs. More information here . Windows System Tray Icons When a programs which is running under Sandboxie asks to place an icon in the system tray area , Sandboxie lets the program place the icon in the real system tray, which is typically located at the bottom right corner of the display. This has the advantage that interaction with the tray icon of the sandboxed program is as easy as interacting with any other tray icon. However, it also means that Windows will record this icon and its description in the history of all tray icons it has ever displayed. It is possible to manually clear this history in Windows . There may also be third-party registry cleaning tools that can erase this information. Disk Defragmentation Disk defragmenter software can be used to organize the contents of the hard disk at the level of data blocks, so that files may be accessed faster by the operating system. Although this is not a privacy concern, the issue of sandboxed programs being able to defragment the disk has been raised and should be addressed. Sandboxie isolation occurs at the higher file level rather than the lower level of data blocks. Moving data blocks around on the disk has no impact on the isolation of the sandbox, and cannot be used by a malicious program to somehow \"move\" its data out of the sandbox. IP Privacy Sandboxie isolation and protection occurs entirely within the local computer and is not visible to any other remote computer. Thus accessing the Internet using a sandboxed program looks the same as accessing the Internet using a program that is not running under Sandboxie. In both cases the remote computer identifies the accessing computer by its IP address. There are various third-party solutions for anonymous Web access. More information here . Windows DNS Host Cache Sandboxie does not prevent the logging and storage of the hosts file (DNS cache) on your Windows machine.

There are various third-party registry cleaning tools that can erase this information. Windows Taskbar On Windows 7 and later, Windows Explorer stores information associated with icons on the taskbar. This information includes the icon for the program and the command used to launch it. The information is stored in files in the following folder, within the user profile folder: %Appdata%\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\Quick Launch\\User Pinned\\ImplicitAppShortcuts The Sandbox Settings > Applications > Miscellaneous settings page includes the setting \"Permit programs to update jump lists in the Windows 7 taskbar\". If this setting is enabled, additional files are created in the following folders, within the user profile folder: %Appdata%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Recent\\CustomDestinations %Appdata%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Recent\\AutomaticDestinations Windows Page File During its normal course of operation, Windows sometimes needs to put away the contents of memory used by one program in order to make room for another program. The memory contents are stored in the Windows page file . Programs that run under Sandboxie are still running in the same Windows operating system as any other program in the computer, so portions of sandboxed and normal programs may end up sitting side by side in the same page file. It is possible to configure Windows to clear the contents of the page file at shutdown. More information here and here . It is possible to configure Windows to encrypt the contents of the page file: Run secpol.msc to open the Local Security Policy editor Expand the group labeled Public Key Policies Right-click Properties on the item labeled Encrypting File System Select Allow to enable Encrypting File System (EFS) Click Apply and then OK Reboot to put the new setting into effect Windows Hibernate File Similar to the Windows Page File, the hibernate file stores a copy of the memory and state of the system before the computer is turned off as part of the hibernate process. Thus the hibernate file may contain bits of memory that were used by a sandboxed program. System Restore Restore points are snapshots of the state of the operating system at some points in time. The System Restore component in Windows XP and later versions records and restores these snapshots. Snapshots are recorded in the (typically inaccessible) folder called System Volume Information and may include many types of files found throughout the system, including within the folders of the sandbox. Thus it is possible that System Restore will create backup copies in its folders for files or programs that exist only in the sandbox. The System Restore component can be set to ignore files and folders in temporary folders, so moving the sandbox to %TEMP%\\SANDBOX (instead of the default C:\\SANDBOX ) and adding the path within the registry key FilesNotToSnapshot , System Restore should ignore the sandbox when creating a Shadow Copy snapshot. More information here . System, Audit and Other Event Logs Windows sometimes records bits of information about running programs in its various event logs . Typically, very little if any information is logged about a program. However, if security auditing has been enabled for some aspects of the system, Windows will have no trouble logging the details of any actions taken by a program running under Sandboxie. Windows has an Event Viewer program which can be used to view and delete the event logs. More information here . Windows System Tray Icons When a programs which is running under Sandboxie asks to place an icon in the system tray area , Sandboxie lets the program place the icon in the real system tray, which is typically located at the bottom right corner of the display. This has the advantage that interaction with the tray icon of the sandboxed program is as easy as interacting with any other tray icon. However, it also means that Windows will record this icon and its description in the history of all tray icons it has ever displayed. It is possible to manually clear this history in Windows . There may also be third-party registry cleaning tools that can erase this information. Disk Defragmentation Disk defragmenter software can be used to organize the contents of the hard disk at the level of data blocks, so that files may be accessed faster by the operating system. Although this is not a privacy concern, the issue of sandboxed programs being able to defragment the disk has been raised and should be addressed. Sandboxie isolation occurs at the higher file level rather than the lower level of data blocks. Moving data blocks around on the disk has no impact on the isolation of the sandbox, and cannot be used by a malicious program to somehow \"move\" its data out of the sandbox. IP Privacy Sandboxie isolation and protection occurs entirely within the local computer and is not visible to any other remote computer. Thus accessing the Internet using a sandboxed program looks the same as accessing the Internet using a program that is not running under Sandboxie. In both cases the remote computer identifies the accessing computer by its IP address. There are various third-party solutions for anonymous Web access. More information here .

The rudimentary approach is to use the regular, non-sandboxed Windows Explorer to navigate inside the folders that make up the sandbox. By using the Sandbox Menu > Sandbox > Explore Contents command, you can open a folder window (unsandboxed) with a view into the sandbox. You can then navigate in the depth of the sandbox folder, and cut sandboxed files in order to paste them somewhere else. The Quick Recovery feature makes it easier to extract files (and even whole folders) that are created and saved by sandboxed programs. It scans a few sandboxed folders, which have to be selected in advance, and lists the files (and folders) it finds within them. These files (and folders) can be recovered into the corresponding location outside the sandbox, or to any location. To invoke the Quick Recovery window, use the Sandbox Menu > Sandbox > Quick Recovery command (or the corresponding command from the Tray Icon Menu ). Quick Recovery also appear as part of the Delete Sandbox window. The Quick Recovery Window The central area which extends to the lower right corner of the window shows the quick-recoverable files and folders in a particular sandbox. Select a file or folder, and then click one of the two Recover to buttons on the left: Recover to Same Folder moves the file (or folder) from the sandbox to a corresponding location outside the sandbox. For example, the picture above shows the file favicon.ico in the sandboxed Desktop folder. Clicking this command on the file will move it to the real desktop folder. Recover to Any Folder first displays a Browse For Folder dialog box, then moves the file (or folder) to the folder selected in the dialog box. These commands are also available if you invoke the context menu on a file or folder, typically by clicking the right mouse button on it. Adding Folders to Quick Recovery As noted, Quick Recovery only scans folders which are explicitly selected. By default, it scans the Desktop , Favorites and Documents folders.

General Information Each settings page within the Resource Access group generally has the following characteristics: There is a Title for the page, for example, Direct File Acccess or Read-Only Registry Access . There is a Short Explanation describing what the setting does. There is a List of Resources that shows the resources that get a special treatment. Depending on the particular setting, it may mean that those resources will be fully accessible to sandboxed programs. Or it may mean that these resources will not be accessible at all. The Short Explanation briefly describes the relationship between those resources and the programs which access them. You should also consult the documentation below for the particular setting, to fully understand what this means. The resources in the list may apply only to a particular program. Generally, however, they apply to All Programs . There is an Add button which adds a new resource entry to the list. There is an Edit/Add (sometimes just Edit ) which edits a resource entry in the list, or adds a new resource entry to the list. There is a Remove button which removes a resource entry from the list. There is a list-box labeled The list above applies to. This list-box associates the resources with a specific program. By default, resources apply to All Programs as shown in the example above. You can select to apply resources to a specific program, by selecting that program from the list-box. You can also type the name of the specific program directly into the list-box. You can also use the Add Pgm button to select a specific program by navigating to its folder. File Access Sandboxie Control > Sandbox Settings > Resource Access > File Access This category manages the following types of resources: Files, folders, drives, and other devices. See General Information above for more information about editing resources and associating resources with particular programs. File Access > Direct Access Allow direct access to some file or folder, bypassing the supervision of Sandboxie. For example, if you add a folder C:\\Downloads , then a program running under Sandboxie will be able to create or update files in that folder. Note that Direct Access exclusions do not apply when the program itself resides in the sandbox. For example, suppose that you allow direct access to a C:\\Downloads folder, and then you go on to install a new Web browser into the sandbox. This new sandboxed browser will not have direct access to the C:\\Downloads folder. Related Sandboxie Ini settings: OpenFilePath File Access > Full Access Similar to Direct Access , but always applies, even if the sandboxed program itself resides in the sandbox. For better protection, you are advised to use Direct Access rather than Full Access whenever possible. Related Sandboxie Ini settings: OpenPipePath File Access > Read-Only Access This access mode excludes the effects of sandboxing on a file (or folder) resource, while allowing a program to read, but not modify, the real resource. Related Sandboxie Ini settings: ReadFilePath File Access > Write-Only Access This access mode hides all files and folders which are located within the selected folder outside the sandbox. However, programs in the sandbox can create new files within the corresponding folder in the sandbox. This setting can only be used effectively on folders. If a file is selected, the effect is the same as the Blocked Access setting (see below). Related Sandboxie Ini settings: WriteFilePath File Access > Blocked Access Deny all access to the resource, for example to a folder containing sensitive data. Blocked Access settings take precedence over all other resource access rules. For example, if an exclusion for C:\\Downloads appears in both Direct Access and Blocked Access , the latter will apply, denying all access to the folder. Related Sandboxie Ini settings: ClosedFilePath Registry Access Sandboxie Control > Sandbox Settings > Resource Access > Registry Access This category manages registry key resources. The registry is a mechanism provided by Windows for programs to store configuration and settings. See General Information above for more information about editing resources and associating resources with particular programs. Registry Access > Direct Access Allow direct access to a registry key resource. Note that Direct Access exclusions do not apply when the program itself resides in the sandbox. This is described in more detail in the File Access category above. Note that unlike in the File Access category, there is no Full Access access mode for registry keys. Related Sandboxie Ini settings: OpenKeyPath Registry Access > Read-Only Access This access mode excludes the effects of sandboxing on a registry key resource, while allowing a program to read, but not modify, the real resource. Related Sandboxie Ini settings: ReadKeyPath Registry Access > Write-Only Access This access mode hides all registry data which is located within the selected registry key outside the sandbox. However, programs in the sandbox can create new registry data within the corresponding folder in the sandbox. Related Sandboxie Ini settings: WriteKeyPath Registry Access > Blocked Access Deny all access to a registry key resource, for example to a key containing Windows policy settings. Blocked Access settings take precedence over all other resource access rules. For example, if an exclusion for a registry key appears in both Direct Access and Blocked Access , the latter will apply, denying all access to the registry key. Related Sandboxie Ini settings: ClosedKeyPath IPC Access Sandboxie Control > Sandbox Settings > Resource Access > IPC Access This category manages exclusions for NT IPC objects. These resources are created by programs running the system as a way to coordinate operations or otherwise communicate. See General Information above for more information about editing resources and associating resources with particular programs. IPC Access > Direct Access Allow direct access to an IPC object resource. Note that unlike in the File Access and Registry Access categories, Direct Access exclusions for IPC objects always apply to all sandboxed programs. Related Sandboxie Ini settings: OpenIpcPath IPC Access > Blocked Access Deny all access to an IPC object resource. Blocked Access settings take precedence over all other resource access rules. For example, if an exclusion for an IPC object appears in both Direct Access and Blocked Access , the latter will apply, denying all access to the object. This setting can be used to override default IPC Access > Direct Access settings in Sandboxie, and block the access. For example, by default Sandboxie allows sandboxed programs to access the audio device. To override this and cut off audio output by sandboxed programs, add an exclusion for \\RPC Control\\AudioSrv . Related Sandboxie Ini settings: ClosedIpcPath Window Access Sandboxie Control > Sandbox Settings > Resource Access > Window Access This category manages exclusions for window classes. These resources are primarily related to windows displayed on the screen, but can also be used by programs as a way to coordinate operations or otherwise communicate. You can specify which window classes, that were created outside the sandbox, will be available for use by sandboxed programs. See General Information above for more information about editing resources and associating resources with particular programs.

For example, __declspec(dllexport) void __stdcall InjectDllMain(HINSTANCE hSbieDll, ULONG_PTR UnusedParameter) { // // locate the address of SbieDll_Hook in SbieDll.dll // typedef void *(__stdcall *P_SbieDll_Hook)( const char *ApiName, void *ApiFunc, void *NewFunc); P_SbieDll_Hook p_SbieDll_Hook = GetProcAddress(hSbieDll, \"SbieDll_Hook\"); // // invoke SbieDll_Hook through the function pointer // p_SbieDll_Hook(...); } Note the use of InjectDllMain (see Inject Dll ) to get a handle to the loaded instance of SbieDll. That is the recommended approach. However, using LoadLibrary or GetModuleHandle to look up SbieDll by name is also fine. Enumerate Sandbox Names Prototype: typedef LONG (__stdcall *P_SbieApi_EnumBoxes)( LONG index, // initialize to -1 WCHAR *box_name); // pointer to WCHAR [34] Export Name: SbieApi_EnumBoxes Parameters: index [in] specifies which sandbox to return. Initialize to -1. Sandboxes are enumerated in the order they appear in Sandboxie.ini. box_name [out] receives the sandbox name. Note: this function cannot be used by a sandboxed program. Return Value: Returns the next value to use for the index parameter. Returns -1 when there is nothing left to enumerate. Sample Code: WCHAR name[34]; int index = -1; while (1) { index = SbieApi_EnumBoxes(index, name); if (index == -1) break; SandboxNames_StringArray.add(name); } Query Sandbox Paths by Sandbox Name Prototype: typedef LONG (__stdcall *P_SbieApi_QueryBoxPath)( const WCHAR *box_name, // pointer to WCHAR [34] WCHAR *file_path, WCHAR *key_path, WCHAR *ipc_path, ULONG *file_path_len, ULONG *key_path_len, ULONG *ipc_path_len); Export Name: SbieApi_QueryBoxPath Parameters: box_name [in] specifies the name of the sandbox for which to return path information. file_path [out] receives the path to the root directory of the sandbox, as set by the FileRootPath setting. The buffer receives at most the number of bytes specified by the file_path_len parameter. Pass NULL to ignore this parameter. key_path [out] receives the path to the root key of the sandbox registry, as set by the KeyRootPath setting. The buffer receives at most the number of bytes specified by the key_path_len parameter. Pass NULL to ignore this parameter. ipc_path [out] receives the path to the root object directory of the sandbox, as set by the IpcRootPath setting. The buffer receives at most the number of bytes specified by the ipc_path_len parameter. Pass NULL to ignore this parameter. file_path_len [in/out] specifies the length in bytes of the file_path buffer. On return, receives the length in bytes needed to receive a complete buffer. key_path_len [in/out] specifies the length in bytes of the key_path buffer. On return, receives the length in bytes needed to receive a complete buffer. ipc_path_len [in/out] specifies the length in bytes of the ipc_path buffer. On return, receives the length in bytes needed to receive a complete buffer. Return Value: Returns zero on success, a non-zero value on error. Sample Code: ULONG FileLen = 0; ULONG KeyLen = 0; ULONG IpcLen = 0; SbieApi_QueryBoxPath( NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, &FileLen, &KeyLen, &IpcLen); // note that lengths are returned as the number of bytes, // rather than number of WCHAR characters WCHAR *FileBuf = malloc(FileLen); WCHAR *KeyBuf = malloc(KeyLen); WCHAR *IpcBuf = malloc(IpcLen); SbieApi_QueryBoxPath( FileBuf, KeyBuf, IpcBuf, &FileLen, &KeyLen, &IpcLen); // now use wcslen to count the number of characters FileLen = wcslen(FileBuf); KeyLen = wcslen(KeyBuf); IpcLen = wcslen(IpcBuf); Query Sandbox Paths by Process ID Prototype: typedef LONG (__stdcall *P_SbieApi_QueryProcessPath)( HANDLE process_id, WCHAR *file_path, WCHAR *key_path, WCHAR *ipc_path, ULONG *file_path_len, ULONG *key_path_len, ULONG *ipc_path_len); Export Name: SbieApi_QueryProcessPath Parameters: process_id [in] specifies the ID of the sandboxed process to query. file_path [out] key_path [out] ipc_path [out] file_path_len [in/out] key_path_len [in/out] ipc_path_len [in/out] The last six parameters are similar to the last six parameters for the QueryBoxPath function, discussed above. However, QueryProcessPath (this function) returns the sandbox paths that are in use by a running program, whereas QueryBoxPath returns the paths as they are recorded in the Sandboxie configuration. Or put another way: Suppose a sandboxed program starts with PID 124, and then some sandbox path (for instance FileRootPath) is set to a new value. At this point, QueryBoxPath will return the new value, but QueryProcessPath for PID 124 will return the old value. Return Value: Returns zero on success, a non-zero value on error.

Return Value: Returns zero on success, a non-zero value on error. Query Process Information Prototype: typedef LONG (__stdcall *P_SbieApi_QueryProcess)( HANDLE process_id, WCHAR *box_name, // pointer to WCHAR [34] WCHAR *image_name, // pointer to WCHAR [96] WCHAR *sid_string, // pointer to WCHAR [96] ULONG *session_id); Export Name: SbieApi_QueryProcess Parameters: process_id [in] specifies the ID of the sandboxed process to query. box_name [out] receives the name of the sandbox in which the process is running. Pass NULL to ignore this parameter. image_name [out] receives the process name. Pass NULL to ignore this parameter. sid_string [out] receives the SID string for the process. Pass NULL to ignore this parameter. session_id [out] receives the logon session number in which the process is running. Pass NULL to ignore this parameter. Return Value: Returns zero on success, a non-zero value on error. Terminate a Single Sandboxed Process Prototype: typedef BOOLEAN (__stdcall *P_SbieDll_KillOne)( HANDLE process_id); Export Name: SbieDll_KillOne Parameters: process_id [in] specifies the process ID for the sandboxed process that should be terminated. Return Value: Returns TRUE on success, FALSE on failure.

The index number can be logically OR'ed with these special values: 0x40000000 - do not scan the [GlobalSettings] section if the specified setting name does appear in the specified section. 0x20000000 - do not expand any variables in the result. 0x10000000 - ignore any settings that originate from a template (typically defined in the Templates.ini file). only query those settings that appear explicitly in the Sandboxie.ini file. value [out] receives the value of the specified setting. value_len [in] specifies the maximum length in bytes of the buffer pointed to by the value parameter. Return Value: Returns zero on success. Returns 0xC000008B if the setting was not found. Any other return value indicates some other error. Update Configuration in Sandboxie.ini Prototype: typedef LONG (__stdcall *P_SbieDll_UpdateConf)( WCHAR operation_code, const WCHAR *password, // limited to 64 chars const WCHAR *section_name, // limited to 32 chars const WCHAR *setting_name, // limited to 64 chars const WCHAR *value) // limited to 2000 chars Export Name: SbieDll_UpdateConf Parameters: operation_code [in] specifies how to update the request setting: 's' to set (overwrite), replacing any existing values 'a' to append the new value at the bottom of a list of values (or simply set the new value if there isn't one already) 'i' to insert the new value at the top of a list of values (or simply set the new value if there isn't one already) 'd' to delete an existing value in a list of values password [in] specifies the password to use if one is required, or NULL or an empty string otherwise. section_name [in] is a required parameter which specifies the section name that contains the setting to set. setting_name [in] is a required parameter which specifies the setting name to set. value [ini] is an optional parameter specifies the new value. If operation_code is 's' and value is omitted, the corresponding setting in the specified section will be deleted. If operation_code is 's' and setting_name is \"*\" (wildcard star) and value is omitted, this function deletes a complete section from the configuration file. Return Value: Returns zero on success. Reload Configuration from Sandboxie.ini Prototype: typedef LONG (__stdcall *P_SbieApi_ReloadConf)( ULONG session_id); Export Name: SbieApi_ReloadConf Parameters: session_id [in] specifies the logon session number to which Sandboxie will log any error messages.

Sample Code: typedef BOOL (__stdcall *P_DeleteFileW)(const WCHAR *Path); P_DeleteFileW pDeleteFileW = NULL; BOOL __stdcall MyDeleteFileW(const WCHAR *Path) { if (Path[0] == L'C') { // silently ignore requests to delete any file on drive C SetLastError(0); return TRUE; } else { // otherwise invoke the original DeleteFileW function return pDeleteFileW(Path); } } main() { pDeleteFileW = GetProcAddress(kernel32dll, \"DeleteFileW\"); pDeleteFileW = SbieDll_Hook(\"DeleteFile\", pDeleteFileW, MyDeleteFileW); } Register for DLL Load/Unload Callbacks Prototype: typedef void (__stdcall *P_DllCallback)(const WCHAR *ImageName, HMODULE ImageBase); typedef BOOLEAN *(__stdcall *P_SbieDll_RegisterDllCallback)( P_DllCallback pCallback); Export Name: SbieDll_RegisterDllCallback This API is available starting with version 3.46 of Sandboxie. Parameters: pCallback specifies a callback function to be invoked whenever any DLL is loaded or unloaded in the process. The callback function cannot be unregistered. The ImageName (first) parameter to the callback function specifies the UNICODE name string for the DLL that was loaded or unloaded. The name string does not include a path. The ImageBase (second) parameter to the callback function specifies the load base address for the DLL, when the callback function is invoked to notify of a DLL load. When the callback function is invoked to notify of a DLL unload, this parameter is set to zero. Return Value: Returns TRUE on success, FALSE if the callback cannot be registered. As of version 3.46, Sandboxie supports up to 8 registrations within a single process.

Sandboxie creates these objects out of the way, to protect the system from harmful changes. But these objects must reside somewhere in the system. This page describes where various types of sandboxed objects are placed. Beginning with version 2.80 of Sandboxie, the layout of the sandbox is not tied to computer-specific device names and account names. See Portable Sandbox for more information. Files Files are created in the Sandbox folder according to the following hierarchy: . FileRootPath . . drive . . . C . . . D . . . Q . . user . . . all . . . current The FileRootPath setting specifies a path to the root of a particular sandbox. In other words, if FileRootPath specifies the folder C:\\MySandbox , then the sub-folders drive and user are created as C:\\MySandbox\\drive and C:\\MySandbox\\user, respectively. If the FileRootPath setting is omitted, the BoxRootFolder setting is used instead. The Box Root Folder setting specifies a path to a group of sandboxes. In other words, if Box Root Folder specifies the folder C:\\MySandbox , then the sub-folders drive and user are created as C:\\MySandbox\\Sandbox\\DefaultBox\\drive and C:\\MySandbox\\Sandbox\\DefaultBox\\user, respectively, and assuming the sandbox is called DefaultBox. Please note that BoxRootFolder is a deprecated setting. As sandboxed programs create new files or modify existing files, Sandboxie redirects these operations to act on paths that lead into the sandbox. If the sandboxed program was trying to create the file C:\\NEW.TXT , it will be redirected to create instead ( FileRootPath )\\drive\\C\\NEW.TXT . If the sandboxed program was trying to create the file C:\\Users\\joe\\Documents\\NEW.TXT , it will be redirected to create ( FileRootPath )\\user\\current\\Documents\\NEW.TXT . Files that are created or modified in or below profile (or home ) folders, such as C:\\Users\\joe (on Windows Vista and later) are redirected into the sandboxed user\\current folder. Files that are created or modified in or below the generic (or All Users ) profile, are redirected into the sandboxed user\\all folder. Other files that don't match either of the above paths are redirected to the sandboxed drive\\X folder, where X would be the drive in which the files were supposed to have been written. Files that are created or modified on a remote network share are redirected into the sandboxed share\\servername\\sharename folder. When a program tries to open a file for which a copy already exists in the sandbox, Sandboxie will redirect the program to the copy of the file that was previously stored in the sandbox. On the other hand, if a copy for the file does not exist in the sandbox, and if the program does not try to modify the file, then Sandboxie will permit read-only access on the original file outside the sandbox. This behavior can be affected with the file-related settings OpenFilePath , ReadFilePath , and ClosedFilePath . Note that the Sandbox folder itself resides on one particular drive, so even as sandboxed programs may create and modify files in multiple drives, all these files will end up residing physically in the same drive -- the drive where the Sandbox folder resides. Apart from the two sub-folders, drive and user , the Sandbox folder itself contains the file RegHive , and typically also RegHive.LOG . These hold the sandboxed registry. See below. Registry Registry keys are created in a sandboxed registry hive. A registry hive is the Microsoft Windows term for a group of related registry keys that are stored in a single hive file . Sandboxie creates the hive file in the Sandbox folder, as the files RegHive and RegHive.LOG . This hive is mounted (or in other words, loaded into the registry) when a sandboxed program starts. The hive is unmounted when all sandboxed programs end. The sandboxed hive has the following position and structure within the global structure of the Windows registry. . HKEY_USERS . . KeyRootPath . . . machine . . . user . . . . current The KeyRootPath setting specifies a path to the root of a particular sandbox. If omitted, it defaults to HKEY_USERS\\Sandbox (user name) (sandbox name) . For example, if the user joe is using the sandbox DefaultBox, the default KeyRootPath is HKEY_USERS\\Sandbox_joe_DefaultBox . As sandboxed programs create new registry keys or modify existing keys, Sandboxie redirects these operations to act on paths that lead into the sandbox. If the sandboxed program was trying to create the key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\NewKey , it will be redirected to create instead ( KeyRootPath )\\machine\\Software\\NewKey . If the sandboxed program was trying to create the key HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\NewKey , it will be redirected to create ( KeyRootPath )\\user\\current\\Software\\NewKey . With the sandboxed registry, the rules for redirection are simpler than for sandboxed files: A registry key created or modified below the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE tree will be redirected below the sandboxed machine key. A registry key created or modified below the HKEY_CURRENT_USER tree will be redirected below the sandboxed user\\current key. A registry key created or modified below the HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT tree will be redirected below the sandboxed user\\current_classes key. Note that the sandboxed user\\current\\software\\classes key is a symbolic link to the user\\current_classes key which means and the keys are effectively synonyms and share the same content in the sandboxed Windows registry. As with files, access to a key which has a copy in the sandboxed registry will be redirected to use the copy in the sandbox. Read-only access to a key which does not have a copy in the sandboxed registry will be permitted to access the key outside the sandbox. This behavior can be affected with the registry-related settings OpenKeyPath , ReadKeyPath , and ClosedKeyPath . Inter-Process Objects These objects are used by programs to share information, synchronize processing, and provide services. These objects are never written to disk and they disappear when the system shuts down. Sandboxie isolates these objects in order to make it possible to run the same program sandboxed and un-sandboxed side-by-side. It also keeps sandboxed programs from interfering with un-sandboxed ones. These objects are created in the NT object namespace. Their position and structure within that namespace are as follows. . IpcRootPath . . BaseNamedObjects . . . Global . . . Local . . . Session . . RPC Control The IpcRootPath setting specifies a path to the root of a particular sandbox. If omitted, it defaults to \\Sandbox(user name)(sandbox name)\\Session (session number) . For example, if the user joe is running in session zero, and using the sandbox DefaultBox, the default IpcRootPath is \\Sandbox\\joe\\DefaultBox\\Session_0_. Below the IpcRootPath , there are object directories which comprise the NT namespace, and match the layout of existing object directories outside the sandbox area. The directories are created with a persistent attribute, which means they will only disappear at system shutdown. Objects created by sandboxed programs are created within the sandbox object directories. If the program is running outside the supervision of Sandboxie, it would typically create such objects in the \\BaseNamedObjects object directory. Note that objects may be created without a name, in which case the object is effectively isolated to the particular program which created it. However, a program can access the internals of another program in order to locate and use such nameless objects. To mitigate this, Sandboxie prevents a program in the sandbox from accessing a program outside the sandbox in this way. The free utility WinObj by Sysinternals (now a part of Microsoft) can be used to display the NT object namespace. Unlike the case with files or registry keys, sandboxed programs are never permitted to access IPC objects outside the sandbox namespace, not even for read-only access. This behavior can be affected with the registry-related settings OpenIpcPath and ClosedIpcPath . Note that Sandboxie includes a number of built-in OpenIpcPath settings to allow programs to function correctly, and in a typical system, more OpenIpcPath settings are applied through compatibility settings for third-party software.","title":"Sandbox Hierarchy"},{"location":"Content/SandboxHierarchy/#sandbox-hierarchy","text":"","title":"Sandbox Hierarchy"},{"location":"Content/SandboxHierarchy/#overview","text":"When sandboxed programs create (or modify) objects, such as files, in fact, some kind of data should be created.

(See the discussion about Context Menus in Programs View or Files And Folders View for more information.) Note that unless new sandboxes are added, Sandboxie lists only one sandbox: DefaultBox. In the Sandbox Settings window, the individual settings are organized into settings pages, and some pages are organized into groups, as shown below. The left part of the window contains the pages and groups. When a settings page is selected (clicked) in the left part of the window, the right part of the window shows the related settings. When a change has been made in a particular page, the change must be applied to Sandboxie before moving to any other settings page. This can be done manually using the Apply button, or automatically by marking the checkbox at the bottom of the window (\"Apply changes when switching to another page\"). The sections below describe each settings page. Configuration changes do not apply to programs that are already running sandboxed at the time the configuration is changed. To keep things simple, you are advised to make configuration changes when no programs are running in the sandbox.

This section describes the structure and contents of the file. As a general rule, manual editing of the configuration file is discouraged. You are advised to use Sandboxie Control to make configuration changes. See Sandbox Settings . Location Sandboxie looks for the file Sandboxie.ini in the following folders, in this order: * In the Windows folder: C:\\Windows on most Windows installations * In the Sandboxie installation folder: typically C:\\Program Files\\Sandboxie or C:\\Program Files\\Sandboxie-Plus The search for Sandboxie.ini ends when an instance of the file is found, and all other instances are ignored. When Sandboxie Control updates the configuration, it rewrites the file Sandboxie.ini file in the folder from which the configuration was last read. Thus, if the file is manually moved, Sandboxie configuration must be manually reloaded . (Restarting the computer would have the same effect.) Note: Sandboxie does not support any other custom location for the Sandboxie.ini file. Structure Configuration settings in the file are split into groups, or sections. A section begins with a line that specifies its name enclosed within square brackets. For example: [SomeSectionName]. The section continues to the end of the file, or until another section begins. There are three types of sections: The Global Settings section contains settings global to Sandboxie. These apply in one way or another to all sandboxes and all user accounts. There can be only one Global Settings section, typically at the top of the configuration file. One Sandbox Settings section for each sandbox known to Sandboxie. A valid sandbox name is a string of letters and digits, and has a maximum length of 32 characters. The Sandbox Settings section should contain the setting Enabled =y. One User Settings section for each user account. These settings record the state of Sandboxie Control for a particular user account, and include such information as the size of the window. These settings are not documented here, but see a brief discussion below. A simple Sandboxie.ini file may look like this. # Sample Sandboxie Configuration File [GlobalSettings] FileRootPath=C:\\Sandbox\\%USER%\\%SANDBOX% # Settings for sandbox DefaultBox [DefaultBox] Enabled=y # Settings for sandbox InstallBox [InstallBox] Enabled=y FileRootPath=D:\\Sandbox\\Install # Sandboxie Control settings for some user [UserSettings_054A02CE] SbieCtrl_UserName=tzuk The example shows four sections: The global section (GlobalSettings), two sandbox sections (DefaultBox and InstallBox), and one user account section (UserSettings_054A02CE). Lines that begin with a hash sign (#) are comments. These lines are skipped. Note: During its operation, Sandboxie Control regularly rewrites the Sandboxie.ini file, and this rewrite loses all comments. However, unrecognized settings are not lost during the rewrite, so one workaround is to write comments in the form Comment=text. The configuration file can contain up to 30,000 lines of text. Each line can be up to 1000 characters long. The file is UNICODE-encoded, which means each character is composed of two bytes. Many text file editors, including the system Notepad, handle this encoding properly. Settings Global Settings: Listed in the navigation bar on the right under the heading Global Settings.

Please see Trace Logging for Sandboxie Plus. Overview In some cases, a program may not function correctly within the sandbox, because it needs access to a system resource which is, by default, protected by Sandboxie, and access to that resource is denied. Note that in this case, the sandboxed program is not creating the resource itself; rather, it expects the resource to already be available for access and use. The trace displays access attempts and makes it possible to somewhat easily identify which resources that are needed for correct operation, have been blocked. Enable the Trace The trace can be activated through different Sandboxie Ini settings: FileTrace logs access to files, folders, and filesystem volumes; KeyTrace logs access to registry keys (but not values within keys); PipeTrace logs access to named pipes and mail slot objects which are used for inter-process communication; IpcTrace logs access to other objects used for inter-process communication, and also logs access attempts by one process to another process; GuiTrace logs window-to-window communications; ClsidTrace logs COM communications; NetFwTrace traces the actions of the firewall components (since version 0.9.0 / 5.51.0); LogAPI library to get additional trace output (see this thread for more information). Each setting accepts a sequence of characters which specifies what to log. The character a logs requests which were allowed; the character d logs requests which were denied. For the FileTrace and PipeTrace settings, the character i logs requests which were allowed because they access a device which is ignored by Sandboxie, such as a CD-ROM. The settings PipeTrace , IpcTrace and GuiTrace are more relevant to the discussion in this page. FileTrace and KeyTrace will usually not be able to provide insight as to why a sandboxed program is malfunctioning. Thus, typically you enable the trace by making this change in Sandboxie Ini : [GlobalSettings] IpcTrace=ad PipeTrace=ad GuiTrace=ad Then use Sandboxie to reload the configuration: * Configure menu -> Reload Configuration on Sandboxie Classic * Options menu -> Reload ini file on Sandboxie Plus Trace options can be set on a per box basis such that only the boxes you need will generate trace logs. You can also adjust the buffer size by adding TraceBufferPages=2560 that will increase it tenfold. Review the Trace for NetFwTrace , IpcTrace and PipeTrace Since version 0.9.0 / 5.51.0, a new option NetFwTrace=* was added to trace the actions of the firewall components. Please note that the driver only logs to the kernel debug output, which you can view with DbgView.exe . On Windows Vista and later, output from the system debugger log is disabled by default. This blog post and this thread explain how to enable it. The following trace will display output in the following format. (Assuming IpcTrace , and PipeTrace enabled.) ... (001404) SBIE (FA) 00120116.01.00000000 \\Device\\NamedPipe\\ShimViewer ... (001404) SBIE (IA) 001F0001 \\ThemeApiPort ... (001404) SBIE (PD) 00000040 001136 (001404) SBIE (PA) 00020400 001136 ... (001404) SBIE (FA) 00000001.0F.FFFFFFFF \\Device\\Afd\\Endpoint (001404) SBIE (FA) 00000001.0F.FFFFFFFF \\Device\\Afd ... (001404) SBIE (ID) 001F0001 \\RPC Control\\protected_storage ... The format is this: (pid) SBIE (ca) (access) (resource) pid identifies the process attempting the access; c indicates the Sandboxie class for the resource -- more on this later; a indicates if the access was allowed (A) or denied (D); access indicates the access requested to the object, and is typically not interesting or important; resource identifies the resource to which access is desired; in the case of process-to-process access, where ca is (PA) or (PD), the resource name is the process id of the process being accessed. Some examples: (001404) SBIE (IA) 001F0001 \\ThemeApiPort Here the process making the request is process id 1404, and was allowed to access the resource named ThemeApiPort . The resource class is I, so this is an inter-process object. The access was allowed because by default, Sandboxie allows this specific access. (001404) SBIE (ID) 001F0001 \\RPC Control\\protected_storage Here the access to the resource protected_storage was denied. By default Sandboxie does not allow this access; however the OpenProtectedStorage setting changes this behavior. (001404) SBIE (FA) 00000001.0F.FFFFFFFF \\Device\\Afd\\Endpoint Here the access is allowed to the resource Endpoint . The resource class is F, so this is a named pipe or a mail slot resource. The access is allowed by default, because the \\Device\\Afd prefix names resources needed for Internet access. Review GuiTrace Entries When GuiTrace is enabled, the trace also produces entries like the following: ... (001404) SBIE (GA) WinHook 0002 on tid=001484 pid=001960 (001404) SBIE (GA) AccHook on tid=000000 pid=000000 ... (001404) SBIE (GD) PostMessage 01224 (04C8) to hwnd=00050060 pid=001324 DDEMLMom (001404) SBIE (GD) SendMessage 49376 (C0E0) to hwnd=00010014 pid=000804 #32769 ... (001404) SBIE (GD) SendInput (001404) SBIE (GA) SendInput These entries have a few formats. The first word after (GA) or (GD) identifies the type of the entry. When the first word is WinHook or AccHook , the entry indicates installation of a hook. Its installation is permitted for (GA) entries, and denied for (GD) entries. WinHook is a standard Windows hook, followed by the type of the hook (see SetWidowsHookEx in MSDN ). AccHook is an accessibility hook (see SetWinEventHook in MSDN ). Both entries identify the thread number (tid) process number (pid) into which the hook was to be installed. When the first word is PostMessage , SendMessage or ThrdMessage , the entry shows denied window communication. The following two numbers indicate the window message number, in decimal and hexadecimal. The entry also indicates the window handle (hwnd) of the target window, the process number (pid) which owns this window, and finally, the internal window class name for the window. Analyze the Trace The point of using the trace is usually to identify the resource that is keeping the sandboxed program from functioning correctly. Consider for example the following trace record: (001404) SBIE (ID) 001F0001 \\BaseNamedObjects\\Xyzzy This shows that access to some Xyzzy resource was denied. Sandboxie does not know this resource, and by default, it denies access to unknown resources. If a sandboxed program begins to malfunction (it may lock up, or it may end abruptly, or just complain about something) soon after this record appears in the trace, it stands to reason that the program was expecting the resource to be accessible. The next step is to add an OpenIpcPath setting for this resource: OpenIpcPath=\\BaseNamedObjects\\Xyzzy This setting tells Sandboxie that access to the Xyzzy resource should not be blocked. Then reload the Sandboxie configuration, clear the old contents of the trace display, and restart the sandboxed program. If the program now performs better, Xyzzy was indeed the problematic resource. But if the program still fails, the trace log can be inspected again for later (or possibly earlier) failed access attempts. Resource Class The trace record shows the Sandboxie resource class of the object. This indicates which OpenXxxPath setting is needed to allow access to the object. When resource class is F, as in (FA) or (FD), the relevant settings are OpenFilePath and ClosedFilePath . When resource class is K, as in (KA) or (KD), the relevant settings are OpenKeyPath and ClosedKeyPath . When resource class is I, as in (IA) or (ID), the relevant settings are OpenIpcPath and ClosedIpcPath . When resource class is G, as in (GA) or (GD), the relevant setting is OpenWinClass . For COM objects displayed by ClsidTrace, the relevant setting is OpenClsid .","title":"Sandboxie Trace"},{"location":"Content/SandboxieTrace/#sandboxie-trace","text":"","title":"Sandboxie Trace"},{"location":"Content/SandboxieTrace/#please-see-resource-access-monitor-for-sandboxie-classic","text":"","title":"Please see Resource Access Monitor for Sandboxie Classic."},{"location":"Content/SandboxieTrace/#please-see-trace-logging-for-sandboxie-plus","text":"","title":"Please see Trace Logging for Sandboxie Plus."},{"location":"Content/SandboxieTrace/#overview","text":"In some cases, a program may not function correctly within the sandbox, because it needs access to a system resource which is, by default, protected by Sandboxie, and access to that resource is denied.

When the first word is WinHook or AccHook , the entry indicates installation of a hook. Its installation is permitted for (GA) entries, and denied for (GD) entries. WinHook is a standard Windows hook, followed by the type of the hook (see SetWidowsHookEx in MSDN ). AccHook is an accessibility hook (see SetWinEventHook in MSDN ). Both entries identify the thread number (tid) process number (pid) into which the hook was to be installed. When the first word is PostMessage , SendMessage or ThrdMessage , the entry shows denied window communication. The following two numbers indicate the window message number, in decimal and hexadecimal. The entry also indicates the window handle (hwnd) of the target window, the process number (pid) which owns this window, and finally, the internal window class name for the window.","title":"Review GuiTrace Entries"},{"location":"Content/SandboxieTrace/#analyze-the-trace","text":"The point of using the trace is usually to identify the resource that is keeping the sandboxed program from functioning correctly. Consider for example the following trace record: (001404) SBIE (ID) 001F0001 \\BaseNamedObjects\\Xyzzy This shows that access to some Xyzzy resource was denied. Sandboxie does not know this resource, and by default, it denies access to unknown resources. If a sandboxed program begins to malfunction (it may lock up, or it may end abruptly, or just complain about something) soon after this record appears in the trace, it stands to reason that the program was expecting the resource to be accessible. The next step is to add an OpenIpcPath setting for this resource: OpenIpcPath=\\BaseNamedObjects\\Xyzzy This setting tells Sandboxie that access to the Xyzzy resource should not be blocked. Then reload the Sandboxie configuration, clear the old contents of the trace display, and restart the sandboxed program. If the program now performs better, Xyzzy was indeed the problematic resource. But if the program still fails, the trace log can be inspected again for later (or possibly earlier) failed access attempts.","title":"Analyze the Trace"},{"location":"Content/SandboxieTrace/#resource-class","text":"The trace record shows the Sandboxie resource class of the object.

For example: \"C:\\Program Files\\Sandboxie\\Start.exe\" /box:TestBox run_dialog A special form of the /box parameter is /box:__ask__ and causes Start.exe to display the sandbox selection dialog box. The parameter /silent can be used to eliminate some pop-up error messages. For example: \"C:\\Program Files\\Sandboxie\\Start.exe\" /silent no_such_program.exe In both silent and normal operation, Start.exe exits with a zero exit code on success, or non-zero on failure.

Parameters can be combined in any order. For example: \"C:\\Program Files\\Sandboxie\\Start.exe\" /box:CustomBox /silent MyProgram.exe Stop Programs Terminate all programs running in a particular sandbox. Note that the request is transmitted to the Sandboxie service SbieSvc, which actually carries out the termination. \"C:\\Program Files\\Sandboxie\\Start.exe\" /terminate \"C:\\Program Files\\Sandboxie\\Start.exe\" /box:TestBox /terminate \"C:\\Program Files\\Sandboxie\\Start.exe\" /terminate_all If the parameter /box:SandboxName is omitted, programs running in the default sandbox, DefaultBox , will be stopped. The form /terminate_all terminates all programs in all sandboxes. Unmount Box Images These commands unmount encrypted box images or RAM disks created by Sandboxie Plus.

The form /mount_protected mounts encrypted box images with the Box Root Protection . Box Root Protection prevents processes running outside the sandbox from accessing the root folder of the encrypted box.

Example output: \"C:\\Program Files\\Sandboxie\\Start.exe\" /listpids | more 3 3036 2136 384 Note that Start.exe is not a console applications, so the output does not appear in a command prompt window unless you pipe the output using a construct such as | more . Delete Contents of Sandbox \"C:\\Program Files\\Sandboxie\\Start.exe\" delete_sandbox \"C:\\Program Files\\Sandboxie\\Start.exe\" delete_sandbox_silent The /box:SandboxName parameter may be specified between Start.exe and the delete command. The __silent_ suffix on the delete command, indicates Sandboxie Start should silently ignore any errors and not display any error messages. The delete operation occurs in two phases: Phase 1 scans the contents of the sandbox and processes files which could pose a problem during the second phase: Junctions (also known as reparse points) are removed. Read-only files and directories are made fully accessible. Files and directories that have very long names are renamed to shorter names. Renames the sandbox to the format __Delete_(sandbox name)_(some random number) . For example, if the sandbox is DefaultBox, it could be renamed to __Delete_DefaultBox_01C4012345678912 . Phase 2 deletes any sandboxes that were processed in phase 1. Sandboxes that were processed in phase 1 are those that have been renamed as described above. More than one sandbox may be deleted in phase 2. By default, the standard system command RMDIR is used to delete the renamed sandbox folder. Alternatively, a third-party delete utility may used. See Secure Delete Sandbox . Issuing the delete_sandbox command causes Start.exe to invoke phase 1 followed by phase 2. Start.exe also accepts these commands to invoke a specific phase: \"C:\\Program Files\\Sandboxie\\Start.exe\" delete_sandbox_phase1 \"C:\\Program Files\\Sandboxie\\Start.exe\" delete_sandbox_phase2 \"C:\\Program Files\\Sandboxie\\Start.exe\" delete_sandbox_silent_phase1 \"C:\\Program Files\\Sandboxie\\Start.exe\" delete_sandbox_silent_phase2 Reload Configuration This command reloads the Sandboxie configuration in SandboxieIni into the active Sandboxie driver. Typically useful after manually editing the Sandboxie.ini file. \"C:\\Program Files\\Sandboxie\\Start.exe\" /reload Note that reloading the configuration does not take effect on sandboxed programs that are already running when this command is issued. Disable Forced Programs The following command runs a program outside the sandbox, even if the program is forced. It is similar to using the Run Outside Sandbox option from the sandbox selection window of the Run Sandboxed command. \"C:\\Program Files\\Sandboxie\\Start.exe\" /dfp c:\\path\\to\\program.exe \"C:\\Program Files\\Sandboxie\\Start.exe\" /disable_force c:\\path\\to\\program.exe Note that /dfp and /disable_force are identical. You can also select this option by holding the Ctrl and Shift keys down when you click the Run Sandboxed command. An older form of this command can temporarily disable the forced programs mode, for all programs. It is similar in function to using the Disable Forced Programs command from the Tray Icon Menu in Sandboxie Control (and not the File Menu ). \"C:\\Program Files\\Sandboxie\\Start.exe\" disable_force Note the missing slash in this command syntax. Note also that this command is not a toggle. It always puts the Disable Forced Programs mode into effect and always restarts the countdown timer. At this time, Start.exe does not offer a way to request the cancellation of this mode.

The delete operation occurs in two phases: Phase 1 scans the contents of the sandbox and processes files which could pose a problem during the second phase: Junctions (also known as reparse points) are removed. Read-only files and directories are made fully accessible. Files and directories that have very long names are renamed to shorter names. Renames the sandbox to the format __Delete_(sandbox name)_(some random number) . For example, if the sandbox is DefaultBox, it could be renamed to __Delete_DefaultBox_01C4012345678912 . Phase 2 deletes any sandboxes that were processed in phase 1. Sandboxes that were processed in phase 1 are those that have been renamed as described above. More than one sandbox may be deleted in phase 2. By default, the standard system command RMDIR is used to delete the renamed sandbox folder. Alternatively, a third-party delete utility may used. See Secure Delete Sandbox . Issuing the delete_sandbox command causes Start.exe to invoke phase 1 followed by phase 2. Start.exe also accepts these commands to invoke a specific phase: \"C:\\Program Files\\Sandboxie\\Start.exe\" delete_sandbox_phase1 \"C:\\Program Files\\Sandboxie\\Start.exe\" delete_sandbox_phase2 \"C:\\Program Files\\Sandboxie\\Start.exe\" delete_sandbox_silent_phase1 \"C:\\Program Files\\Sandboxie\\Start.exe\" delete_sandbox_silent_phase2","title":"Delete Contents of Sandbox"},{"location":"Content/StartCommandLine/#reload-configuration","text":"This command reloads the Sandboxie configuration in SandboxieIni into the active Sandboxie driver.

As most applications cannot function this way, it hooks all NTDLL.dll calls redirecting them through an interface in the SbieDrv. The driver then can inspect the call arguments, makes the calling thread impersonate the original unrestricted token, execute the system call, and de-impersonate the thread before returning control to user mode. This way, a process running under the supervision of Sandboxie cannot issue syscalls with the original token, even if it would undo the ntdll.dll hooks. For this mechanism to work, Sandboxie utilizes a couple of undocumented operations: To create the restricted token, it uses currently the unexported function SepFilterToken as well as a couple of offsets (RestrictedSidCount, RestrictedSids, UserAndGroups, UserAndGroupCount). This mechanism could be replaced by calling CreateToken or CreateTokenEx, however these functions are not exported in the kernel either. To eliminate the dependencies on unexported symbols, for this part of the process ZwCreateTokenEx should be exported and utilized. To be able to invoke any syscall on the behalf of the sandboxed process, the driver must know the function address and argument count for each syscall index. Sandboxie currently obtains those by finding the address of the unexported syscall table by analyzing the KeAddSystemServiceTable function. To eliminate the dependencies on unexported symbols, it is required to export KeServiceDescriptorTableShadow. Due to limitations in PsImpersonateClient (starting with Windows XP SP2), it is required to call it with impersonation level SecurityIdentification and then change that in the opaque thread object to SecurityImpersonation. To eliminate the dependencies on unexported symbols, it would be required to provide a documented mechanism for a driver to achieve any desired impersonation level. To replace a sandboxed processes primary token, it is required to clear the PrimaryTokenFrozen bit in the EPROCESS structure, this operation is triggered from a callback registered with PsSetLoadImageNotifyRoutine. I have not investigated if it would be feasible to do the token replacement before it gets officially frozen. Other than the above essential dependencies, Sandboxie gets the Clipboard object from the window station object in order to adjust the integrity level for the stored items such that they can be accessed by the sandboxed applications.","title":"SandboxieDrv use of undocumented kernel exports to do its token magic"},{"location":"Content/TokenMagic/#sandboxiedrv-use-of-undocumented-kernel-exports-to-do-its-token-magic","text":"Sandboxie implements isolation by running sandboxed processes with a heavily restricted primary token.

The Power of Control DNS Query Control shifts the balance of power towards users, granting them unprecedented control over how sandboxed programs interact with DNS servers. This control manifests in a multitude of benefits: 1. Security Reinforcement: With the ability to filter and block DNS queries for specific domains, users can mitigate potential security risks. Malicious domains or known threat vectors can be preemptively blocked, shielding the system from potential hazards. 2. Privacy Enhancement: By redirecting certain DNS queries, users can ensure that sensitive information remains confidential. This redirection curtails instances where sandboxed applications inadvertently reveal confidential data through DNS queries. 3. Content Control: DNS Query Control allows users to manage content access. Unwanted domains or inappropriate content can be blocked, ensuring that sandboxed applications are limited to approved and safe online resources. 4. Network Analysis: The logging component of this feature offers users the opportunity to monitor DNS activities. This data can provide insights into the behavior of sandboxed applications, potentially revealing any anomalous or suspicious network activity. How DNS Query Control Works The mechanics of DNS Query Control are elegantly intricate. Users can selectively block or redirect DNS queries made by sandboxed programs for specific domains. This process involves defining rules within the sandbox configuration, dictating how DNS queries to certain domains should be handled. This level of granularity empowers users to tailor the DNS experience within the sandboxed environment according to their security and privacy preferences. Embrace the Future of Network Control DNS Query Logging, Filtering, and Redirection transcends traditional sandboxing capabilities.

Some of these features (*) are however only available to users with a Support Certificate which can be obtained by contributing to the Sandboxie project or purchased in our online shop . Some more features (**) are available to participants of the Sandboxie-Insider program. Rule Specificity * With this option rules are prioritized based on their specificity (see changelog/docs for details) this way sub paths can be readable/writeable while parent parts are still protected. Security enhanced sandboxes * Restrict syscall elevation to approved known safe / filtered syscalls Limit access to device endpoints to known safe / filtered endpoints Privacy enhanced sandboxes * With this feature, by applying a preset rule collection, all locations potentially containing personal data can be protected. Applications running in boxes with personal data protection will see an empty PC with no user data on it. Compartment Mode * This mode is intended to optimize compatibility at the cost of security, here Sandboxie\u2019s token-based isolation scheme is not used. Isolation is limited to the FS minifilter as well as registry and object callbacks. This has the potential to greatly improve compatibility with various applications. Virtual Disk Integration ** RamDisk support , available since the latest insider build, allows you to create a virtual disk in your system's memory, using the ImDisk driver, which can speed up file access and increase confidentiality as all box contents will be discarded when the disk is unmounted (manually or automatically on reboot). Encrypted Box Image support is currently in development and allows you to create encrypted sandboxed environments for an even greater protection of your confidential data. With this feature the box file root is being mounted from an AES-XTS encrypted box image, other ciphers are available as well. Upcoming additions to this root functionality will contain secure box passphrase handling and a driver extension to prevent applications not running in the encrypted sandbox from accessing the sandboxed files. Enhanced network filtering and redirection ** Proxy injection is yet another feature which has been added in the insider builds, it allows to force any application to use a Socks 5 proxy instead of a direct connection. DNS query logging, filtering and redirection feature allows you to block, or redirect DNS queries made by sandboxed programs for selected domains. WFP (Windows Filtering Platform) support With this feature, Sandboxie can be like an application firewall which applies the rules on a per-sandbox basis, allowing the same application access to Internet in one box while blocking it in another. Windows 11 context menu integration Process/Thread handle filtering (obCallbacks) Using this mechanism greatly improves on isolation of processes and provides enhanced security. Win32 syscall hooking With this feature, Win32 syscalls can get the same treatment as NT syscalls, which helps with graphics and HW acceleration. New UI with dark mode and much more Sandboxie-Plus bring an entirely new Qt based UI sandman.exe Customizable per box run menu Global hotkey to terminate all boxes INI section editor for easy configuration of advanced options Box event triggers/scripts Ability to stop selected applications from running globally, regardless of box presets Snapshots Sandboxie-Plus can create box snapshots, with them it is possible to easily revert a box to a defined previous state. Box set to auto delete will auto-revert when available to the last snapshot allowing to benefit from a fresh clean box each time but with some preset configuration Enhanced debug/trace monitor Fake admin privileges Allows to make all processes in a box think they have admin permissions and act accordingly, without the potential drawbacks of granting them admin permissions Box size monitor Monitor and list box size in an own column Start Menu integration Integrate start menu entries from sandboxes into the host start menu Sandbox SID isolation Instead of using anonymous login SID, it uses custom SIDs per-sandbox like Sandboxie/DefaultBox. This way, processes from separate sandboxes won\u2019t be able accessing each other\u2019s resources. Breakout Process Allows to specify which applications shall run unsandboxed when launched within the sandbox. A combination of this and ForceProcess allows for a simple priority system. Document Breakout is an extension to the already well-known Breakout mechanism to allow to open selected file types saved to an open file path from within the sandbox in an unsandboxed instance of the associated application. ** USB drive sandboxing ** This feature allows you to automatically sandbox any USB drive that you plug into your computer, which adds an extra layer of protection to your system.

This cutting-edge feature empowers users with an unprecedented level of control over network connectivity, enabling the forceful redirection of application traffic through a Socks 5 proxy instead of relying on direct connections. A Glimpse into Proxy Injection Proxy Injection stands as a pioneering addition to the Sandboxie-Plus suite, designed to elevate the security and manageability of application interactions within sandboxed environments. This feature redefines how users can influence network behavior by seamlessly injecting a Socks 5 proxy mechanism into applications, ensuring that all network-bound activities are routed through a designated proxy server. The Power of Control At its core, Proxy Injection embodies the concept of control. With this feature, users wield a newfound ability to enforce the use of a Socks 5 proxy for any application, regardless of its inherent network settings. This degree of control translates into numerous tangible advantages: 1. Enhanced Privacy: By channeling application traffic through a Socks 5 proxy, users can obscure their IP addresses and enhance their online privacy. This becomes particularly crucial in scenarios where applications might inadvertently expose sensitive information. 2. Network Segmentation: Proxy Injection enables the isolation of application traffic, ensuring that interactions are confined to the proxy server. This isolation adds an extra layer of security by minimizing direct communication between applications and external servers. 3. Bypassing Geo-Restrictions: Users can strategically utilize Proxy Injection to bypass geo-restricted content or access region-specific services by routing their traffic through proxies located in desired regions. 4. Network Monitoring and Control: For security-conscious users, Proxy Injection becomes a vital tool for observing and regulating application network activity. By centralizing network traffic through a proxy server, users can closely monitor data exchanges and potentially thwart malicious activity. How Proxy Injection Works The mechanics of Proxy Injection are elegantly simple, yet profoundly effective. Users can designate specific applications (or entire boxes) to undergo proxy injection, effectively compelling these applications to establish their network connections through the selected Socks 5 proxy. The result is a controlled network environment that aligns with security and privacy preferences, effectively mitigating potential vulnerabilities that might arise from direct connections. Embrace the Future of Network Control Proxy Injection emerges as a visionary feature that redefines network interaction paradigms within sandboxed environments.

Alternatively, you can support the project on Patreon at the GREAT tier or above. All users with CONTRIBUTOR or HUGE certificates are automatically eligible. The insider builds introduce several new features that are designed to improve the Sandboxie experience and enhance the security of your system: RamDisk support , available since the latest insider build, allows you to create a virtual disk in your system's memory, using the ImDisk driver, which can speed up file access and increase confidentiality as all box contents will be discarded when the disk is unmounted (manually or automatically on reboot). Encrypted Box Image support is currently in development and allows you to create encrypted sandboxed environments for an even greater protection of your confidential data. With this feature the box file root is being mounted from an AES-XTS encrypted box image, other ciphers are available as well. Upcoming additions to this core functionality will contain secure box passphrase handling and a driver extension to prevent applications not running in the encrypted sandbox from accessing the sandboxed files. Proxy injection is yet another feature which has been added in the insider builds, it allows to force any application to use a Socks 5 proxy instead of a direct connection. DNS query logging, filtering and redirection feature allows you to block, or redirect DNS queries made by sandboxed programs for selected domains. USB drive sandboxing is yet another new feature that has been added to the Insider builds. This feature allows you to automatically sandbox any USB drive that you plug into your computer, which adds an extra layer of protection to your system. Insider builds include support for EFS, which is a feature in Windows that allows you to encrypt files and folders to protect them from unauthorized access. Document Breakout is an extension to the already well-known Breakout mechanism to allow to open selected file types saved to an open file path from within the sandbox in an unsandbox instance of the associated application.

WFP implementation To enable WFP functionality, add NetworkEnableWFP=y to the [GlobalSettings] section of the configuration file Sandboxie Ini and reboot the machine or reload the driver for it to take effect. WFP filtering works for both inbound and outbound traffic. To enable blocking globally, add AllowNetworkAccess=n to the [GlobalSettings] section. To enable WFP blocking for a box, such as DefaultBox, add AllowNetworkAccess=n to the [DefaultBox] section. To exempt blocking for a box, such as DefaultBox, add AllowNetworkAccess=y to the [DefaultBox] section. To allow a selected program in a box, such as DefaultBox, add AllowNetworkAccess=program.exe,y to the [DefaultBox] section. To block a selected program in a box, such as DefaultBox, add AllowNetworkAccess=program.exe,n to the [DefaultBox] section. Limitations of the WFP implementation: WFP will filter only TCP/UDP protocols. The WFP filter rules can be implemented by restricting communication only to specified IP addresses or selected port numbers by using a rule based hierarchy based on \"NetworkAccess=...\" (as described later). Restricted boxed processes will still be able to resolve domain names using the system service but will not be able to send or receive data packets directly. User Mode Packet Filter implementation Sandboxie Plus v0.9.3 also added a fully functional rule-based packet filter in user mode for the case when NetworkEnableWFP=y is not set. This mechanism also replaces the primitive \"BlockPort=...\" functionality of older versions. Limitations of the user mode filter: If WFP support is not enabled, the same rules can still be set and used, but they will be applied only by means of user mode hooks. Unlike the WFP implementation, they will apply only to outgoing connections and there are no enforcement guarantees as user mode hooks can be bypassed or disabled by a malicious application. Caveat: For reliable isolation, the use of kernel mode WFP-based filtering is strongly recommended . The rationale for two filtering modes: The rationale for implementing network functionality in both user mode and kernel mode (driver) is twofold. First, it allows for easier debugging of the rule processing code (simpler to debug in user mode) as both modes use the same code to make decisions based on the preset rules. Second, the WFP callouts are global i.e. they are triggered for any process on the system whether sandboxed or not. In the latter case they don't do anything and the use of a hash map to identify sandboxed programs that require action can provide optimal performance. Combining WFP with user mode filtering: If you set \"block internet access\" for a given process and have the driver (for WFP) enabled, you can select for that box which method to apply: using WFP or blocking network devices. Even though the approach of blocking the network device endpoints is more absolute, it has been known to cause some applications to crash. WFP and multiple firewalls Commercially available firewalls implement the Windows Filtering Platform (WFP) by installing a provider of filter rules. Some use the standard Windows Firewall's provider, while others create their own. Some use WFP at the user mode level (no drivers), while others use WFP in kernel mode (based on their own driver). If several firewalls are installed and active at the same time, each driver installs its own callout functions at the positions in the network stack it wants to control and all those functions are then called by the kernel for ALL the drivers (providers). This results in an amalgamation of rules set by each firewall. An inbuilt arbitration mechanism in WFP then decides which rules take precedence. Some firewalls recommend turning off the native Windows firewall in order to work effectively, while others can work even with the Windows firewall active. Users who have found a firewall they like are typically very reluctant to switch. Does Sandboxie Plus conflict with other firewalls? Another firewall installed on a system (including the Windows firewall) does not conflict with Sandboxie Plus and can be used to block programs (sandboxed or not), but its rules are typically global and based on absolute program paths. The WFP implementation in Sandboxie Plus, on the other hand, offers the added advantage of \"per box\" rules which affect only processes within a given sandbox (without specifying program paths). For example, Box1 may allow network access for Program1, while in Box2 the same Program1 may be blocked or even allowed but with a different set of rules for network access. Implementing network access rules in Sandboxie Plus The Sandman UI provides us with a method for editing and testing network rules. Right-click on a box and select \"Sandbox Options\" from the drop-down menu (or simply double-click on a box) to bring up the Box Options UI. Then click on Network Options in the left panel and select the Network Firewall tab. The Test Rules row appears at the bottom, below the rule list (which may or may not be already populated). One can enter program name, port number, IP address and protocol to see which rules are in play and which rule will be applied in the end. The choice of blocking (using WFP or by denying access to network devices) is selected in the Process Restrictions tab. The attributes at our disposal (with some examples of syntax) are: - Action = Allow | Block (selected from the Network Restrictions tab) - Program = program.exe - Port = 80,443,1000-2000 - Address = 111.222.333.444,0.0.0.0-255.255.255.255 - Protocol = TCP | UDP The following rules precedence scheme determines rule hierarchy: 1. A rule for a specified program trumps a rule for all programs except a given one, trumps rules for all programs. 2. A rule with a Port number or IP address trumps a rule without: - 2a. A rule with an IP address and Port number trumps a rule with an IP address only or Port number only. - 2b. A rule with one IP address trumps a rule with an IP address range that is besides that on the same level. 3. Block rules trump Allow rules. 4. A rule without a Protocol means all protocols. - 4a. A rule with a Protocol trumps a rule without, if it is the only difference. Some examples: NetworkAccess=*,Block;Port=80,443 - block rule for selected port numbers NetworkAccess=*,Block;Port=80,443;Protocol=TCP - block rule for all TCP connections NetworkAccess=*,Block;Port=80,443;Address=0.0.0.0-255.255.255.255 - block rule to deny network access NetworkAccess=*,Allow;Port=80,443;Address=111.222.333.444 - allow any program to access this IP address NetworkAccess=chrome.exe,Allow;Port=80,443 - allow chrome.exe to access any IP address NetworkAccess=chrome.exe,Allow;Port=80,443;Address=111.222.333.444 - allow chrome.exe to access one IP address BlockPorts template: - NetworkAccess=*,Block;Port=137,138,139,445 - enabled by default since version 1.3.4 / 5.58.4","title":"WFP (Windows Filtering Platform) support"},{"location":"PlusContent/WFPSupport/#wfp-windows-filtering-platform-support","text":"Sandboxie Plus v0.9.3 introduced a unique approach to manage network connectivity by implementing not only a kernel mode (using a driver) \"per box\" firewall built on Windows Filtering Platform (WFP) but also a user mode , outbound rule-based packet filter.","title":"WFP (Windows Filtering Platform) support"},{"location":"PlusContent/WFPSupport/#wfp-implementation","text":"To enable WFP functionality, add NetworkEnableWFP=y to the [GlobalSettings] section of the configuration file Sandboxie Ini and reboot the machine or reload the driver for it to take effect.

The WFP filter rules can be implemented by restricting communication only to specified IP addresses or selected port numbers by using a rule based hierarchy based on \"NetworkAccess=...\" (as described later). Restricted boxed processes will still be able to resolve domain names using the system service but will not be able to send or receive data packets directly.","title":"WFP implementation"},{"location":"PlusContent/WFPSupport/#user-mode-packet-filter-implementation","text":"Sandboxie Plus v0.9.3 also added a fully functional rule-based packet filter in user mode for the case when NetworkEnableWFP=y is not set. This mechanism also replaces the primitive \"BlockPort=...\" functionality of older versions. Limitations of the user mode filter: If WFP support is not enabled, the same rules can still be set and used, but they will be applied only by means of user mode hooks. Unlike the WFP implementation, they will apply only to outgoing connections and there are no enforcement guarantees as user mode hooks can be bypassed or disabled by a malicious application. Caveat: For reliable isolation, the use of kernel mode WFP-based filtering is strongly recommended . The rationale for two filtering modes: The rationale for implementing network functionality in both user mode and kernel mode (driver) is twofold. First, it allows for easier debugging of the rule processing code (simpler to debug in user mode) as both modes use the same code to make decisions based on the preset rules. Second, the WFP callouts are global i.e. they are triggered for any process on the system whether sandboxed or not. In the latter case they don't do anything and the use of a hash map to identify sandboxed programs that require action can provide optimal performance. Combining WFP with user mode filtering: If you set \"block internet access\" for a given process and have the driver (for WFP) enabled, you can select for that box which method to apply: using WFP or blocking network devices. Even though the approach of blocking the network device endpoints is more absolute, it has been known to cause some applications to crash.","title":"User Mode Packet Filter implementation"},{"location":"PlusContent/WFPSupport/#wfp-and-multiple-firewalls","text":"Commercially available firewalls implement the Windows Filtering Platform (WFP) by installing a provider of filter rules. Some use the standard Windows Firewall's provider, while others create their own. Some use WFP at the user mode level (no drivers), while others use WFP in kernel mode (based on their own driver). If several firewalls are installed and active at the same time, each driver installs its own callout functions at the positions in the network stack it wants to control and all those functions are then called by the kernel for ALL the drivers (providers). This results in an amalgamation of rules set by each firewall. An inbuilt arbitration mechanism in WFP then decides which rules take precedence. Some firewalls recommend turning off the native Windows firewall in order to work effectively, while others can work even with the Windows firewall active. Users who have found a firewall they like are typically very reluctant to switch. Does Sandboxie Plus conflict with other firewalls? Another firewall installed on a system (including the Windows firewall) does not conflict with Sandboxie Plus and can be used to block programs (sandboxed or not), but its rules are typically global and based on absolute program paths. The WFP implementation in Sandboxie Plus, on the other hand, offers the added advantage of \"per box\" rules which affect only processes within a given sandbox (without specifying program paths). For example, Box1 may allow network access for Program1, while in Box2 the same Program1 may be blocked or even allowed but with a different set of rules for network access.","title":"WFP and multiple firewalls"},{"location":"PlusContent/WFPSupport/#implementing-network-access-rules-in-sandboxie-plus","text":"The Sandman UI provides us with a method for editing and testing network rules. Right-click on a box and select \"Sandbox Options\" from the drop-down menu (or simply double-click on a box) to bring up the Box Options UI. Then click on Network Options in the left panel and select the Network Firewall tab. The Test Rules row appears at the bottom, below the rule list (which may or may not be already populated). One can enter program name, port number, IP address and protocol to see which rules are in play and which rule will be applied in the end. The choice of blocking (using WFP or by denying access to network devices) is selected in the Process Restrictions tab. The attributes at our disposal (with some examples of syntax) are: - Action = Allow | Block (selected from the Network Restrictions tab) - Program = program.exe - Port = 80,443,1000-2000 - Address = 111.222.333.444,0.0.0.0-255.255.255.255 - Protocol = TCP | UDP The following rules precedence scheme determines rule hierarchy: 1. A rule for a specified program trumps a rule for all programs except a given one, trumps rules for all programs. 2. A rule with a Port number or IP address trumps a rule without: - 2a. A rule with an IP address and Port number trumps a rule with an IP address only or Port number only. - 2b. A rule with one IP address trumps a rule with an IP address range that is besides that on the same level. 3. Block rules trump Allow rules. 4. A rule without a Protocol means all protocols. - 4a.
