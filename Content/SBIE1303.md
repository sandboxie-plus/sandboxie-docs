# SBIE1303

**OBSOLETE**

**Message:** SBIE1303 Only one sandbox can be active at a time

**Logged To:** [Popup Message Log](PopupMessageLog.md).

**Explanation:**

This error message appeared in the unregistered version of Sandboxie when programs were started in more than one sandbox at the same time. The unregistered version was limited in that it can only run programs in one sandbox at a time.

This limitation is no longer present since Sandboxie 5.31.4.
