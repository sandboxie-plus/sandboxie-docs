# Windows XP Mode and Sandboxie Integration

With Windows 7, Microsoft introduced **Windows XP Mode**, a virtualized installation of 32-bit Windows XP Service Pack 3 running side-by-side with the primary Windows 7 operating system.

**Windows XP Mode** is exclusively available on the Professional, Enterprise, and Ultimate editions of Windows 7.

The 32-bit edition of Sandboxie can be installed into the 32-bit Windows XP running within the 64-bit Windows 7. Due to the seamless integration of **Windows XP Mode** into the Windows 7 environment, 32-bit Sandboxie can function reasonably well within a 64-bit Windows 7 system.

While **Windows XP Mode** is easier to use than a stand-alone virtual machine running Windows XP, as it is better integrated into Windows 7, it exposes your Windows 7 system and documents to potential malicious changes originating in the **Windows XP Mode** operating system.

Sandboxie offers a solution by providing isolation for applications, including web browsers, within their own sandboxes. This enhances security by preventing potential threats from affecting the host system.

Here are step-by-step instructions to install Sandboxie and Firefox within **Windows XP Mode**:

1. Open the **Windows XP Mode** operating system.

2. Optionally, download and install Firefox. Ensure that Firefox designates itself as the default web browser during its installation process. Additionally, tweak Firefox preferences and install any desired add-ons.

3. Download and install Sandboxie within the **Windows XP Mode** environment.

4. Optionally, download and install an antivirus program for your **Windows XP Mode** operating system.

5. Log out of the **Windows XP Mode** operating system.

6. In your Windows 7 Start Menu, you should find the Sandboxie program group:

   `Windows 7 Start Menu > All Programs > Windows Virtual PC > Windows XP Mode Applications > Sandboxie`

7. Select "Run Web browser sandboxed" to launch Firefox within the Sandboxie environment, providing an added layer of security.
