# Alert Process

The _AlertProcess_ setting in [Sandboxie Ini](SandboxieIni.md) is a global configuration that specifies the names of programs triggering message [SBIE1301](SBIE1301.md) when started outside the sandbox. This setting can be conveniently managed within the application interface:

![Alert Programs](../Media/AlertPrograms.png)

To utilize this setting, add program names to the [GlobalSettings] section, as demonstrated:

```ini
[GlobalSettings]
AlertProcess=iexplore.exe
AlertProcess=firefox.exe
```

This example would trigger an alert if Internet Explorer or Firefox is initiated outside the sandbox.
