# Linger Process

_LingerProcess_ is a sandbox setting in [Sandboxie Ini](SandboxieIni.md). It specifies names of programs that will be automatically terminated when they are the last programs that remain in execution in a particular sandbox. This is useful as some programs occasionally launch _helper programs_ to carry out a specific task, and the helper program remains in execution even after the original program has ended. For example:

```ini
[DefaultBox]
LingerProcess=jusched.exe
```

_jusched.exe_ is part of the Sun Java framework. It is occasionally launched when Internet Explorer starts the Java framework. This _LingerProcess_ example setting specifies that if _jusched.exe_ remains the last program running in the sandbox DefaultBox, then it should be terminated.

LingerProcess will not terminate a process if that process was the first process launched in the sandbox.

For example, the default configuration includes Adobe Acrobat Reader as a LingerProcess because it is typically launched when viewing PDF files through the Web browser and remains running even after the browser has closed.

```ini
LingerProcess=acrord32.exe
```

However, if you manually start Adobe Acrobat Reader sandboxed, for example by running it from the Sandboxie Start Menu, then the LingerProcess setting will not apply to that process.
