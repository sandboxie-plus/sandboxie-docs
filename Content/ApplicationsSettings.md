#### Email Reader

![](../Media/EmailReaderSettings.png)  

This settings page offers quick configuration for the following email programs:

*   Outlook Express
*   Office Outlook
*   Windows Vista Mail
*   Windows Live Mail
*   Mozilla Thunderbird
*   Mozilla SeaMonkey
*   Opera Mail
*   IncrediMail
*   Eudora
*   The Bat!

Select (highlight) the desired configuration and click the _Add_ button to enable it for this sandbox.

You may also need to tell Sandboxie where your mailbox data files reside, in the following cases:

*   If your mailbox resides in a non-default or non-standard location.
*   If you use the Eudora or The-Bat! email software.

To do that, open [Sandbox Settings > Applications > Folders](ApplicationsSettings.md#folders), select your email software from the drop-down list, and then select a folder location to be associated with it.

After completing the email configuration, you may want to test it, to make sure that even when running under Sandboxie, new emails are not lost when you delete the sandbox. To do that, follow the steps outlined in [Test Email Configuration](TestEmailConfiguration.md).

If your email program is not known to Sandboxie, you can use [Sandbox Settings > Resource Access > File Access > Direct Access](ResourceAccessSettings.md#file-access--direct-access) to explicitly add direct access to the folder containing your mailbox data files.

[Sandboxie Control](SandboxieControl.md) > [Sandbox Settings](SandboxSettings.md) > Applications > Folders

#### Accessibility Settings

[Sandboxie Control](SandboxieControl.md) > [Sandbox Settings](SandboxSettings.md) > Applications > Accessibility

![](../Media/AccessibilitySettings.png)

This settings page offers quick configuration for the following screen reading programs:

*   JAWS
*   NVDA
*   Windows-Eyes
*   System Access

Accessibility support in Windows allows any program to provide hints and information about the content it is displaying. Screen reader software typically uses these hints to offer more detail about the content of the screen.

Normally, the isolation of Sandboxie prevents the screen reader from accessing the accessibility hints provided by the sandboxed program.

Enabling the setting will weaken the protection of the Sandboxie in order to permit two-way communication between the screen reader program and the sandboxed program.

You may wish to enable [Sandbox Settings > Restrictions > Drop Rights](RestrictionsSettings.md#drop-rights) to compensate for the lost protection.
