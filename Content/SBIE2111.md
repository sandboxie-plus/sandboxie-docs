# SBIE2111


**Message:** SBIE2111 Process is not accessible: _program_, call _call_

**Logged To:** [Popup Message Log](PopupMessageLog.md).

**Explanation:**

This is an informational message.

Before v1.0.16 / 5.55.16, Sandboxie allowed sandboxed programs to read the memory of any unsandboxed program belonging to the current user, this is obviously a bad idea if your goals is not only infection prevention but also data protection. Hence, from v1.0.16 / 5.55.16 onwards Sandboxie will not allow for _PROCESS_VM_READ_ on unsandboxed processes or processes belonging to other sandboxes.
To facilitate compatibility, this build introduces a [ReadIpcPath](ReadIpcPath.md) sandbox setting.
