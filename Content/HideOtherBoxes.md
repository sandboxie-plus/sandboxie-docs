# Hide Other Boxes

_HideOtherBoxes_ is a sandbox setting in [Sandboxie Ini](SandboxieIni.md) available since v0.3 / 5.42. By default, Sandboxie enables this feature, which allows processes to be hidden from other boxes. Example of disabling this setting:

```
   .
   .
   .
   [DefaultBox]
   HideOtherBoxes=n
```
