# Messages From Sandboxie

The _Messages From Sandboxie_ window is displayed automatically whenever Sandboxie logs at least one error or informational message. (For more information about Sandboxie messages, [SBIE Messages](SBIEMessages.md).)

The window displays one message per line, as in the example below.

Clicking the _Help_ button opens the Web browser and navigates to the documentation page for the highlighted message.

Clicking the _Hide_ button indicates that you don't wish to receive this message again. If the message contains an information detail, the _Hide_ button hides the message only in combination with that particular detail.

For example, the [SBIE1304](SBIE1304.md) message shown above has the detail _osk.exe_. In this case, the _Hide_ button will hide future occurrences of [SBIE1304](SBIE1304.md) for _osk.exe_. If [SBIE1304](SBIE1304.md) is issued for some other program name, it will still be displayed.

Clicking the _Close_ button closes the window.

## Log Messages To A File
It's possible to log _Messages From Sandboxie_ to a file with a simple configuration inside the registry:
```cmd
reg.exe add "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SbieSvc" /t REG_SZ /v LogFile /d "2;C:\Windows\System32\LogFiles\Sandboxie.log" /f
```
The `LogFile` value consists of two pieces of information:
- `2` is the log level. Only two values are correct: `2` (classic log) or `3` (log with process SID)
- `C:\Windows\System32\LogFiles\Sandboxie.log` is the full path of the log

Example of output for a log level of 2:
```
2022-09-02 01:04:18 SBIE1308 Program cannot start due to restrictions - powershell.exe [ChromeBox]
2022-09-02 01:04:18 SBIE1308 Program cannot start due to restrictions - powershell.exe [ChromeBox]
2022-09-02 01:04:18 SBIE1308 Program cannot start due to restrictions - HelpPane.exe [ChromeBox]
```

Since version 1.3.3 / 5.58.3, it is possible to pass logs in verbose mode to have the SID of the account used by the target process.

Example of output for a log level of 3:
```
2022-09-02 01:04:18 SBIE1308 Program cannot start due to restrictions - powershell.exe [ChromeBox] (DESKTOP-RZ4242\administrator)
2022-09-02 01:04:18 SBIE1308 Program cannot start due to restrictions - powershell.exe [ChromeBox] (DESKTOP-RZ4242\administrator)
2022-09-02 01:04:18 SBIE1308 Program cannot start due to restrictions - HelpPane.exe [ChromeBox] (DESKTOP-RZ4242\administrator)
```

Another registry key allows to filter and split logs on specific messages:
```cmd
reg.exe add "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SbieSvc" /t REG_SZ /v LogFile /d "2;C:\Windows\System32\LogFiles\Sandboxie.log" /f
reg.exe add "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SbieSvc" /t REG_SZ /v MultiLog /d "1308,1307" /f
```
This simple configuration will:
- put all logs without filter inside `C:\Windows\System32\LogFiles\Sandboxie.log`
- create _one file per box_ (ie: `C:\Windows\System32\LogFiles\Sandboxie_DefaultBox.log`) with only event 1308 and 1307
