Sandboxie-Live is a fast update service (stable channel) for project supporters (users with a supporter certificate) and/or adventurous people (preview channel) wanting to try out the latest fixes and discover the newest bugs.

In the "Support & Updates" tab in the "Global Options", the user can now choose from the following release channels:

1. Stable - GitHub Releases
2. Preview - GitHub Pre-Releases

There the user can also select how to behave when a "New Version" (where an installer is available) or a "Version Update" (where only individual files of the existing installation will be updated) is found.

For a "New Version", the following options are available:
- Notify
- Download & Notify
- Download & Install

For a "Version Update", the following options are available:
- Ignore
- Notify
- Download & Notify
- Download & Install
- What about a regedit function to browse the registry changes.

There is no "Ignore" option for "New Version", as that is covered by disabling the update check.

In the "Stable" channel, a check for "Version Update" is only available to supporters with a valid certificate. In this channel, all updates are signed and consist of the latest compatibility templates and urgent bug-fixes and translations.

In the "Preview" channel, the "Version Update" consists of unsigned test builds (except the signed driver) released every few days (like 1.6.0, 1.6.1a and 1.6.1b), as here the updates contain not only half-tested fixes but also new functionality which may not yet be free of bugs.
