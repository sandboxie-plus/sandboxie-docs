## Introduction
Sandboxie is a sandbox-based isolation software for Windows that lets you try and run untrusted applications without worrying about unwanted changes to your files or registry.

After Sandboxie became [open source](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2020/04/09/sandboxie-is-now-an-open-source-tool/), it was decided to release the documentation in the same way, in order to be accessible and easily updated from the community than the documentation available on [sandboxie-plus.com](https://sandboxie-plus.com) and other archived sources.

A GitHub Pages site based on this content is also available: [https://sandboxie-plus.github.io/sandboxie-docs](https://sandboxie-plus.github.io/sandboxie-docs)
