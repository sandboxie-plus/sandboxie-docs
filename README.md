## Introduction

Sandboxie is a sandbox-based isolation software for Windows that lets you run untrusted applications without worrying about unwanted changes to your files or registry.

After Sandboxie became [open source](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2020/04/09/sandboxie-is-now-an-open-source-tool/), it was decided to release the documentation so that it would be easily updated by the community, as opposed to the documentation available at [sandboxie-plus.com](https://sandboxie-plus.com) and other sources.
