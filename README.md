# Sandboxie-docs
Sandboxie is a free and open source application isolation software for Windows that lets you try and run untrusted applications without worrying about unwanted changes to your files or registry.
* Browse the web without fear of malicious downloads
* Install and run untrusted software without worrying about losing files or damaging your system
* Identify changes to your files and registry settings that your applications are trying to make
* Prevent applications from "calling home" or stealing your personal data

# Why this documentation is hosted on GitHub?
After Sandboxie became open source, it was decided to release the documentation in the same way, in order to be accessible and easily updated from the community. So the following help topics tend to be more up-to-date than the documentation available on [sandboxie-plus.com](https://sandboxie-plus.com) and other archived sources.
